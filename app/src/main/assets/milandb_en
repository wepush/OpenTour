Leonardo’s intention was to create a work that would eclipse all previous equestrian statues, particularly those of his masters, Verrocchio and Donatello (whose works were dedicated to Colleoni and Gattamelata respectively). Leonardo was more interested in the horse than the rider - his horse was to stand 7m high, a feat never before attempted. For this reason, he filled pages and pages with anatomical sketches studying the musculature and proportions of the horse. He calculated that casting the giant work would require up to 100 tonnes of bronze. The project never came to fruition; however, it was finally completed in 1999 by the sculptress Nina Akamu.","tips":"In 1499, French troops entered the Lombard city under the command of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, arch enemy of the Sforza.

Four ‘giants’ were placed on the top of the arch, works by Giambattista Perabò symbolising the main rivers of Lombardy: the Po, the Adda, the Ticino and the Olona.","tips":"Milanese shopkeepers were forced to finance the construction of the gate.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza XXV Aprile","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.48076","9.18695"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5571a3a1694d61043a2d0000/porta_garibaldi.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b888d694d6147f84e0000","distance":102,"time_walk":123,"time_bike":61},{"id":"55535eae694d6103fa5e0200","distance":361,"time_walk":435,"time_bike":217},{"id":"5550d1c6694d6103fa640000","distance":477,"time_walk":575,"time_bike":287},{"id":"554b6e57694d61267e680100","distance":674,"time_walk":812,"time_bike":406},{"id":"5550c2eb694d6103fa190000","distance":693,"time_walk":835,"time_bike":417},{"id":"5559bec2694d6103fab50200","distance":751,"time_walk":905,"time_bike":452},{"id":"554b2733694d61267eb40000","distance":800,"time_walk":964,"time_bike":482},{"id":"5551b6a5694d6103fa850000","distance":800,"time_walk":964,"time_bike":482},{"id":"554b331b694d61267ef60000","distance":810,"time_walk":976,"time_bike":488},{"id":"554b437a694d61267e440100","distance":815,"time_walk":982,"time_bike":491}]},{"id":"554b6ed9694d61267e6f0100","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di Sant'Antonio abate","description":"","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Sant'Antonio","street_number":"5","coordinates":["45.46109","9.19336"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5570558b694d61f4c99c0000/chiesa_di_sant_antonio_abate.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b3a3e694d61267e020100","distance":73,"time_walk":88,"time_bike":44},{"id":"5549da64694d61267e120000","distance":141,"time_walk":170,"time_bike":85},{"id":"554b7d80694d6147f81d0000","distance":197,"time_walk":237,"time_bike":119},{"id":"5550c778694d6103fa300000","distance":221,"time_walk":266,"time_bike":133},{"id":"554b3360694d61267ef90000","distance":252,"time_walk":304,"time_bike":152},{"id":"554b701b694d61267e800100","distance":257,"time_walk":310,"time_bike":155},{"id":"555c6930694d6103faee0200","distance":262,"time_walk":316,"time_bike":158},{"id":"55535f90694d6103fa6d0200","distance":270,"time_walk":325,"time_bike":163},{"id":"55520165694d6103fa3e0100","distance":281,"time_walk":339,"time_bike":169},{"id":"5549f352694d61267e880000","distance":281,"time_walk":339,"time_bike":169}]},{"id":"5551cf11694d6103fa040100","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Pinacoteca di Brera","description":"The Pinacoteca di Brera is a national gallery of ancient and modern art, placed in the namesake Milan Palazzo.

The result of these works was to create the current area bordered by San Lorenzo, the namesake Roman columns, and Piazza Vetra.

It was designed by the architect Carlo Maciachini (1818–1899) in an eclectic style that combines Byzantine and Gothic references with a prevalent Romantic taste. The design of this 19th century building is characterised by a dominant, almost musical motif, the beats of which are marked by stones of alternate colours. Construction got under way in 1864, and the cemetery was opened in 1866; since then, it has been embellished further by many Italian sculptures — in classical as well as contemporary style — including Greek temples, elaborate obelisks, and other original works, such as a scaled-down version of Trajan’s Column. Due to the exceptional artistic value of the sculptures, funerary shrines, and other works found in it, the Cimitero Monumentale is regarded as a veritable open-air museum. The main entry gate consists of the Famedio, a bulky Neo-medieval building made of different marbles and bricks. The name Famedio derives from the Latin term famae aedes, meaning ‘temple of fame’.","tips":"The Cimitero Monumentale houses the grave of Italy’s foremost Romantic novelist Alessandro Manzoni as well as those of other famous Milanese.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazzale Cimitero Monumentale","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.48444","9.17977"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0288465600","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"dsc.cimiteromonumentale@comune.milano.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"8.00","time_to":"18.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705701694d61f4c9af0000/cimitero_monumentale.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5550d18f694d6103fa610000","distance":693,"time_walk":835,"time_bike":417},{"id":"554b888d694d6147f84e0000","distance":735,"time_walk":886,"time_bike":443},{"id":"55535eae694d6103fa5e0200","distance":758,"time_walk":913,"time_bike":457},{"id":"5562e04f694d6193020f0000","distance":1020,"time_walk":1229,"time_bike":614},{"id":"554b7ecf694d6147f82d0000","distance":1087,"time_walk":1310,"time_bike":655},{"id":"5550bf85694d6103fa0e0000","distance":1104,"time_walk":1330,"time_bike":665},{"id":"5550d1c6694d6103fa640000","distance":1143,"time_walk":1377,"time_bike":689},{"id":"554b3e80694d61267e1b0100","distance":1159,"time_walk":1396,"time_bike":698},{"id":"554b9027694d6147f88e0000","distance":1163,"time_walk":1401,"time_bike":701},{"id":"5559bec2694d6103fab50200","distance":1193,"time_walk":1437,"time_bike":719}]},{"id":"554b8b67694d6147f86b0000","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Basilica di San Nazaro in Brolo","description":"","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza San Nazaro in Brolo","street_number":"5","coordinates":["45.45836","9.19255"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0258307719","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/557051e3694d61f4c9750000/basilica_di_san_nazaro_in_brolo.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b7076694d61267e850100","distance":188,"time_walk":227,"time_bike":113},{"id":"554b3360694d61267ef90000","distance":220,"time_walk":265,"time_bike":133},{"id":"5549daa3694d61267e150000","distance":275,"time_walk":331,"time_bike":166},{"id":"554b3a3e694d61267e020100","distance":292,"time_walk":352,"time_bike":176},{"id":"554b8c42694d6147f8700000","distance":297,"time_walk":358,"time_bike":179},{"id":"5549e938694d61267e560000","distance":306,"time_walk":369,"time_bike":184},{"id":"554b6ed9694d61267e6f0100","distance":309,"time_walk":372,"time_bike":186},{"id":"5550c778694d6103fa300000","distance":318,"time_walk":383,"time_bike":192},{"id":"5549da64694d61267e120000","distance":337,"time_walk":406,"time_bike":203},{"id":"554b329b694d61267ef00000","distance":380,"time_walk":458,"time_bike":229}]},{"id":"554b6e57694d61267e680100","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di Sant'Angelo ","description":"The church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, better known as the church of Sant'Angelo, is located in central Milan, near Porta Nuova.

He died a martyr under Emperor Trajan Decius in 250, punished for high treason: he had dared to prevent Emperor Philippus, a murderer, from entering the temple. Together with Saint Babylas died three children: Urbanus, Prilidianus, and Epolonius, the young sons of Teodula, who had entrusted them to Babylas to educate them in the Christian faith. Over the centuries, the Basilica di San Babila underwent numerous architectural modifications. In 1826, the terrible conditions it was in suggested some the plan to demolish it. However, such plans never came to fruition, and, between 1881 and 1890, the architect Paolo Cesa Bianchi carried out a restoration of the church, bringing it back to its original appearance and adding to it a Neoromanesque façade, which was completed in 1905 by the architect Cesare Nava.","tips":"The Basilica, which dates back the late 11th century, was probably built over an area on which had stood a pagan temple.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Corso Venezia","street_number":"2/A","coordinates":["45.46725","9.19824"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0276002877","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.sanbabila.org","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"info@sanbabila.org","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.30","time_to":"12.00"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"15.30","time_to":"19.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705178694d61f4c9720000/basilica_di_san_babila.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5562e0f5694d619302120000","distance":90,"time_walk":108,"time_bike":54},{"id":"554b2ec6694d61267ed50000","distance":109,"time_walk":131,"time_bike":66},{"id":"5549f525694d61267e940000","distance":130,"time_walk":157,"time_bike":78},{"id":"554b7120694d61267e890100","distance":172,"time_walk":207,"time_bike":104},{"id":"5551caaa694d6103faea0000","distance":229,"time_walk":276,"time_bike":138},{"id":"5549f2c1694d61267e820000","distance":229,"time_walk":276,"time_bike":138},{"id":"5549f3ee694d61267e8c0000","distance":236,"time_walk":284,"time_bike":142},{"id":"5549eac9694d61267e5c0000","distance":289,"time_walk":348,"time_bike":174},{"id":"554b6883694d61267e560100","distance":306,"time_walk":369,"time_bike":184},{"id":"5550c67a694d6103fa2d0000","distance":308,"time_walk":371,"time_bike":186}]},{"id":"554b7120694d61267e890100","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di San Carlo al Corso","description":"The church of San Carlo al Corso is located in the namesake piazza.

The current façade is the result of a 1871 restoration by Carlo Maciachini, which maintained the marble round portal with architrave, a gallery of Gothic arches, and the three statues above the portal. With this restoration, the architect tried to reinstate the Gothic features of the original façade, eliminating later additions and modifications.

This church was run by the eremitani di San Marco fathers, and it was dedicated to Saint Mary of Garegnano. Next to this church, during the early 1400s, was built a convent for the Augustinian friars, who restored the ancient church in late Gothic style, which was typical of that century. As construction was completed on the coronation of Francesco Sforza as Duke of Milan (1451), the church was dedicated to Santa Maria Incoronata (Saint Mary crowned), in honour of the new lord of the city. In 1460, his wife Bianca Maria Visconti, lady of Cremona, wanted a second church built next to the church of her husband, one that was perfectly identical and connected to the first, so as to form a single new church: with this work, Bianca Maria wished to seal publicly her faithfulness to her husband.

dockyard). This is the only church in Milan that preserves an authentic early Christian style of the first canonical type, a symbol of simplicity; due to the absence of other overlapping styles, it is a living catalogue of the architectural components and suggestions of early Christian ideas. It was founded in the year 770 by the Longobard King Desiderius, who dedicated it to the Virgin Mary. Its dedication eventually changes to that of Saint Vincent, because this saint’s remains were found in an urn in the Crypt. The suffix In Prato was acquired due to the fact that the church stands on a farm called Prata, which belonged to bishop Odelperto. This church’s original structure survived because none of the several restorations ever modified it significantly, and, as mentioned, it is the only church still bearing testimony the most ancient aspect of Milan’s Christianity.","tips":"Some fragments found during restoration were immured along the church’s left side. They consist of cinerary urns, gravestones, capitals, scraps of barriers, and a 10th century epitaph of abbot Giselberto.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Daniele Crespi","street_number":"6","coordinates":["45.45769","9.17386"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"028373107","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.sanvincenzoinprato.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"sanvincenzoinprato@chiesadimilano.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.45","time_to":"12.00"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"15.30","time_to":"19.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f2fe6d69720711020000/basilica_di_san_vincenzo_in_prato.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"555318f9694d6103fae70100","distance":450,"time_walk":542,"time_bike":271},{"id":"5553277b694d6103fa1a0200","distance":463,"time_walk":558,"time_bike":279},{"id":"5554c120694d6103faad0200","distance":479,"time_walk":577,"time_bike":289},{"id":"554b6d88694d61267e5f0100","distance":493,"time_walk":594,"time_bike":297},{"id":"554b803a694d6147f83c0000","distance":494,"time_walk":595,"time_bike":298},{"id":"5550d3ab694d6103fa700000","distance":495,"time_walk":596,"time_bike":298},{"id":"555326d0694d6103fa140200","distance":526,"time_walk":634,"time_bike":317},{"id":"55520217694d6103fa480100","distance":549,"time_walk":661,"time_bike":331},{"id":"554b2ba6694d61267ec60000","distance":550,"time_walk":663,"time_bike":331},{"id":"5550c476694d6103fa230000","distance":561,"time_walk":676,"time_bike":338}]},{"id":"554b8e28694d6147f8870000","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di San Vittore al Corpo","description":"The church of San Vittore al Corpo used to be the basilica of the Olivetan friars, who lived in the attached monastery, which has now been converted to a science and technology museum. According to the original plan, the façade should have been preceded by a Corinthian pronaos with a barrel vault. However, the façade appears today to have been left incomplete, with a front characterised by two distinct orders: the lower one, punctuated by twelve pilasters, and the upper one, comprised of four engaged columns that support a triangular frontispiece. The church interiors are characterised by a structural separation between the area of the transept and apse and that of the three naves before it, which is the result of the presence of a dome supported by four bulky pillars. The central nave is covered by a coffered barrel vault decorated by portrayals of saints, whose remains should be preserved within the church; the two lateral naves, separated by pillars, are covered by dome vaults partitioned into elegant panels. Twelve chapels, six per side, are found along the lateral naves.","tips":"According to the 1700s scholar Serviliano Latuada, the church assumed its current name because it was there that the remains of Saint Vittore were buried after his martyrdom.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via San Vittore","street_number":"25","coordinates":["45.46315","9.17096"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0248005351","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.basilicasanvittore.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"sanvittore@chiesadimilano.it","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705552694d61f4c9990000/chiesa_di_san_vittore_al_corpo.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5551c0c3694d6103faa10000","distance":26,"time_walk":31,"time_bike":16},{"id":"554b2ba6694d61267ec60000","distance":210,"time_walk":253,"time_bike":127},{"id":"5550d3ab694d6103fa700000","distance":233,"time_walk":281,"time_bike":140},{"id":"554b3bd9694d61267e050100","distance":280,"time_walk":337,"time_bike":169},{"id":"554b6d88694d61267e5f0100","distance":299,"time_walk":360,"time_bike":180},{"id":"554b8a6a694d6147f85e0000","distance":312,"time_walk":376,"time_bike":188},{"id":"554b405c694d61267e260100","distance":386,"time_walk":465,"time_bike":233},{"id":"55536acf694d6103fa830200","distance":413,"time_walk":498,"time_bike":249},{"id":"5552136c694d6103faa00100","distance":451,"time_walk":543,"time_bike":272},{"id":"554b4534694d61267e500100","distance":507,"time_walk":611,"time_bike":305}]},{"id":"555d91f5694d6103fa020300","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Basilica di Sant'Agostino ","description":"","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Copernico","street_number":"9","coordinates":["45.48806","9.20099"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f30e6d69720711030000/basilica_di_sant_agostino.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5551b952694d6103fa980000","distance":361,"time_walk":435,"time_bike":217},{"id":"5550c932694d6103fa430000","distance":382,"time_walk":460,"time_bike":230},{"id":"55520697694d6103fa5f0100","distance":561,"time_walk":676,"time_bike":338},{"id":"5559bec2694d6103fab50200","distance":615,"time_walk":741,"time_bike":370},{"id":"554b3e1f694d61267e140100","distance":1017,"time_walk":1225,"time_bike":613},{"id":"55535eae694d6103fa5e0200","distance":1034,"time_walk":1246,"time_bike":623},{"id":"55536060694d6103fa760200","distance":1056,"time_walk":1272,"time_bike":636},{"id":"554b7ecf694d6147f82d0000","distance":1097,"time_walk":1322,"time_bike":661},{"id":"5550d1c6694d6103fa640000","distance":1099,"time_walk":1324,"time_bike":662},{"id":"55535b79694d6103fa250200","distance":1161,"time_walk":1399,"time_bike":699}]},{"id":"5550d3ab694d6103fa700000","type":"Arches, Gates and Walls","name":"Pusterla di Sant'Ambrogio","description":"","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Carducci","street_number":"41","coordinates":["45.46214","9.17358"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f4436d69720711140000/pusterla_di_sant_ambrogio.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b2ba6694d61267ec60000","distance":55,"time_walk":66,"time_bike":33},{"id":"554b6d88694d61267e5f0100","distance":71,"time_walk":86,"time_bike":43},{"id":"5551c0c3694d6103faa10000","distance":207,"time_walk":249,"time_bike":125},{"id":"554b8e28694d6147f8870000","distance":233,"time_walk":281,"time_bike":140},{"id":"55536acf694d6103fa830200","distance":255,"time_walk":307,"time_bike":154},{"id":"5552136c694d6103faa00100","distance":264,"time_walk":318,"time_bike":159},{"id":"5554c120694d6103faad0200","distance":426,"time_walk":513,"time_bike":257},{"id":"554b3bd9694d61267e050100","distance":431,"time_walk":519,"time_bike":260},{"id":"554b8a6a694d6147f85e0000","distance":471,"time_walk":567,"time_bike":284},{"id":"555c9def694d6103faf70200","distance":495,"time_walk":596,"time_bike":298}]},{"id":"554b9027694d6147f88e0000","type":"Other monuments and Places of interest","name":"Acquario civico","description":"The Acquario civico di Milano was established in 1906 as part of the World Expo, and it was the only pavilion in Parco Sempione not to be dismantled after the event.

The winner of a 1937 architectural competition, its construction brought to a close the process of urban renewal in the centre of Milan. This was the brainchild of Giuseppe Mengoni, who conferred an imposing aspect on the area surrounding the Duomo. \u2028The complex of two symmetrical buildings mirrors the arch of the Galleria on the other side of Piazza Duomo. The idea was to restore balance to the square and to mark the transition from the ancient to the modern. The original facades, faced in Candoglia marble, are opened on the first and second levels by a double-series of high rounded arches. The ground floor features rectangular doorways with natural-motif cornices by Arturo Martini. After a period of post-war neglect, it was restored and used as municipal and provincial offices in the 1950s.  . Beginning in early 2009, the Arengario was transformed into the new home of the Museo del Novecento (Museum of the Twentieth Century) by the architects Italo Rota and Fabio Fornasari.","tips":"During restoration works on 19th December 2007, the first Italian ‘media façade’ (i.e. a 487m2 LED screen called MIA [Milano In Alto]) was affixed to the covered front of the building.

The church has a Greek-cross floorplan with four equal arms (unusual at the time in Milan). At the intersection there is an octagonal dome, crowned by a narrow lantern. At the end of each arm, there is an identical, sober facade. The triple-naved interior, however, is more elaborate and spectacular. The timber roof truss is supported by fluted stone pillars with octagonal bases. The Ionic capitals are decorated with images of skulls and bones, alluding to the function of the complex and typical of Baroque iconography. The decoration of the portico reveals a wavy design rich in tricks of perspective.","tips":"Since 2014, it has been the site of the Museo dei Bambini di Milano.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":30,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Enrico Besana","street_number":"12","coordinates":["45.4598","9.20521"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"6.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0243980402","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.muba.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"info@muba.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo"],"time_from":"9.30","time_to":"15.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr"],"time_from":"9.30","time_to":"18.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["sa","su"],"time_from":"10.00","time_to":"19.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f4556d69720711150000/rotonda_della_besana.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"55536ea8694d6103fa8d0200","distance":332,"time_walk":400,"time_bike":200},{"id":"554b2e3d694d61267ecf0000","distance":374,"time_walk":451,"time_bike":225},{"id":"554b8c84694d6147f8740000","distance":453,"time_walk":546,"time_bike":273},{"id":"554b6fd2694d61267e7c0100","distance":523,"time_walk":630,"time_bike":315},{"id":"554b3d63694d61267e110100","distance":605,"time_walk":729,"time_bike":364},{"id":"5549ee73694d61267e740000","distance":610,"time_walk":735,"time_bike":367},{"id":"555b5281694d6103fad60200","distance":620,"time_walk":747,"time_bike":373},{"id":"554b8805694d6147f8480000","distance":628,"time_walk":757,"time_bike":378},{"id":"554b43cd694d61267e470100","distance":647,"time_walk":780,"time_bike":390},{"id":"5550c3e2694d6103fa200000","distance":698,"time_walk":841,"time_bike":420}]},{"id":"5550cd59694d6103fa570000","type":"Buildings","name":"Planetario di Milano","description":"The Milan Planetarium is an educational museum, with a dome inside which images of the stars and their movements in the night sky are projected.

In the mid-1920s, it was decided to create a ‘sport city’ in the vicinity of the San Siro racecourse. The project was directed by the Milanese engineer Cesare Marescotti, who designed oddly-shaped leisure pools and playgrounds. The original complex consisted of two pools embellished with a pier, fake rocks, a bridge, jetties, harbours and Venetian street lamps. In the central pavilion there was a restaurant with a dance floor. It was not a great success, however, and in 1936 the site was bought by the local council, which prioritised sport at the expense of the more ‘frivolous’ elements.  Extra tennis courts, boule courts and an ice rink were constructed, and the pleasure boats removed.","tips":"During the late 30s and early 40s, the Lido was one of the most popular spots in Milan.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":30,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazzale Lotto","street_number":"15","coordinates":["45.48162","9.14147"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"7.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"6.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Cumulativo ridotto","description":"","price":"2.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"02392791","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.milanosport.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"10.00","time_to":"19.00"}],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"55531c0f694d6103faf60100","distance":765,"time_walk":922,"time_bike":461},{"id":"55531a7d694d6103faed0100","distance":906,"time_walk":1092,"time_bike":546},{"id":"5562dee6694d619302080000","distance":1079,"time_walk":1300,"time_bike":650},{"id":"5550c12a694d6103fa110000","distance":1630,"time_walk":1964,"time_bike":982},{"id":"55531adc694d6103faf00100","distance":2008,"time_walk":2419,"time_bike":1210},{"id":"55531b3b694d6103faf30100","distance":2259,"time_walk":2722,"time_bike":1361},{"id":"554b3e80694d61267e1b0100","distance":2346,"time_walk":2827,"time_bike":1413},{"id":"555b5ecf694d6103fad90200","distance":2419,"time_walk":2914,"time_bike":1457},{"id":"5550bf85694d6103fa0e0000","distance":2429,"time_walk":2927,"time_bike":1463},{"id":"554b7cc1694d6147f80f0000","distance":2515,"time_walk":3030,"time_bike":1515}]},{"id":"5562e962694d619302230000","type":"Other monuments and Places of interest","name":"Fieramilano","description":"","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":30,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Fieramilano Rho","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.51956","9.07828"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0249971","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.fieramilano.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"fieramilano@fieramilano.it","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f3db6d697207110e0000/fiera_milano.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5559b9dd694d6103fab00200","distance":3830,"time_walk":4614,"time_bike":2307},{"id":"554b7cc1694d6147f80f0000","distance":4379,"time_walk":5276,"time_bike":2638},{"id":"55531a7d694d6103faed0100","distance":5701,"time_walk":6869,"time_bike":3434},{"id":"5562dee6694d619302080000","distance":5846,"time_walk":7043,"time_bike":3522},{"id":"55531c0f694d6103faf60100","distance":6207,"time_walk":7478,"time_bike":3739},{"id":"5562e3db694d619302150000","distance":6484,"time_walk":7812,"time_bike":3906},{"id":"55531b3b694d6103faf30100","distance":6633,"time_walk":7992,"time_bike":3996},{"id":"554b3e80694d61267e1b0100","distance":7698,"time_walk":9275,"time_bike":4637},{"id":"5550c12a694d6103fa110000","distance":8097,"time_walk":9755,"time_bike":4878},{"id":"55531c82694d6103faf90100","distance":8159,"time_walk":9830,"time_bike":4915}]},{"id":"55520385694d6103fa500100","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Museo dei Cappuccini","description":"The museum was set up to offer an insight into the cultural and religious world of the Minor Capuchin Friars of Lombardy, in the context of Milanese history and tradition.

The exact dates are uncertain, as are the identity of the commissioner and the circumstances of the church foundation. Many scholars, but not all, identify this church with the basilica once called Porziana, a stronghold of the Aryan heretics, who were driven away by Ambrose in the fourth century. It is nevertheless certain that, when it was built, the basilica was the largest edifice with a central plan in the West. The dedication of the place of worship to Saint Lawrence the martyr is confirmed only after the year 590, when Milan was already under Longobard rule.","tips":"In the rear of the Basilica di San

The central aisle is separated from the side ones by two rows of marble Corinthian columns supporting round arches. The ceiling is a barrel vault with lunettes that reaches 25m in height, with small rosettes, six on each side, providing light. The side aisles, however, are sail vaulted and lit by tall mullioned windows in stained glass created between 1988 and 1996 and designed by Don Domenico Sguaitamatti. The transept is barrel vaulted at the same height as the nave. On the far walls there are two altars surmounted by large triple-mullioned windows.","tips":"An earlier church dedicated to Our Lady of Grace was present on the left bank of the Naviglio Grande in the sixteenth century; moreover, in 1556, a chapel was built to accommodate an image of the Madonna considered miraculous.

It was built in the fifteenth century at the behest of the aristocrat Pietro Tanzi. The brick façade is preceded by a pebble mosaic pavement, depicting a compass rose. There is a cloister to the left and a bell tower to the right, set back slightly from the façade. The cloister recalls the style of the Romanesque. Used as the oratory courtyard, it preserves numerous lapide (tombstones), mostly from the church. On the left side of the transept is a fresco depicting the ‘White Virgin of Mercy of Casoretto’, attributed to a young Pisanello. In the second arch to the right is the triptych attributed to Bergognone (or his student Bevilacqua), depicting the ‘Resurrection of Christ, between John the Baptist and John the Evangelist’.","tips":"It was christened ‘Santa Maria Bianca’ to distinguish it from other churches dedicated to the Virgin in the same period: the Chiesa di Santa Maria Nera di Loreto, near the square of the same name, and the Chiesa di Santa Maria Rossa in Crescenzago.

According to tradition, it was Charles II d'Amboise, governor of Milan at the time of Louis XII of France, who, after being cured by the miraculous spring water, founded the institution in 1507. “Rich people wishing to be cured of every ill” were brought to the sanctuary. The church had long been attributed to Leonardo da Vinci – as well as to Bramante and Cristoforo Solari due to the presence of architectural elements inspired by classic monuments – until 1982, when the archivist Grazioso Sironi found and published a contract of 17th March 1508, in which Giovanni Antonio Amadeo is named as the architect.","tips":"In ancient times, the water flowing from an underground spring beneath the sanctuary was considered miraculous, and used to treat osteoarthritis and arthritis. In the 19th century, as the result of a fire in a neighbouring bitumen factory, the water table was polluted and the original spring was closed. The eleven taps at the church today supply common tap water, which comes from the water supply of the city’s aqueduct.\n.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza S.

The rusticated blocks of the basement imitate natural rock, while the rest of the decorations are a revival of 18th century stucco. When the scaffolding was removed from the façade in 1903, there was a public outcry. Two female nudes by Ernesto Bazzaro above the main entrance were considered too provocative and eventually removed.","tips":"In 1900, the entrepreneur Ermenegildo Castiglioni, who had inherited a fortune from his grandfather in 1886, decided to build a palace in Corso Venezia.

On the death of Count Bolagnos, the palace passed into the hands of the Ospedale Maggiore di Milano. It was sold by auction to the Marquis Giuseppe Viani in 1759, who enlarged and embellished the palace, acquiring and incorporating the neighbouring buildings, until at least 1770.

It is now the site of Museo di Milano and the Costume Moda Immagine collection. It has been inhabited over the centuries by various families of the Milanese aristocracy. The first important family to come into possession of it was the House of Casati, who bought it at the end of the sixteenth century. Traces of the decorations of this period still exist in two halls of the piano nobile situated in the rear wing overlooking the garden (painted coffered ceilings and pieces of a frieze with cherubs, dated 1651). The deepest imprint on the palace, however, was left by the Villa family, who purchased it in 1733. Giovanni Villa added Baroque flourishes, which conferred on both the interior and the exterior of the palace its current appearance.","tips":"When Palazzo Sormani, site of the Museo di Milano, was destroyed by bombing  during the Second World War, it was decided to rehouse the surviving collection of art and relics in Palazzo Morando.

The latest restoration took place in 1996, after a terrorist bombing had damaged it in 1993. This restoration was directed by the original architect’s son, Jacopo Gardella. The building has three façades, facing north, east, and south, whereas building’s western side leans against an adjacent building. The PAC‘s roof is composed of small, parallel, copper-coated trusses on which are located the skylights, in the general style of factory buildings. The northern and eastern façades have remained identical to those of the 18th century, with the exclusion, on the eastern façade, of the glass and iron archivolted gate, which was introduced to serve as entrance.","tips":"PAC is one of the earliest examples in Italy of an exhibition space designed for the display of contemporary art.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":90,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":2,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Palestro","street_number":"14","coordinates":["45.47283","9.19937"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"6.5","recipients":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"4.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Gruppi","description":"","price":"6.5","recipients":[]},{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0288446359","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.pacmilano.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"c.mostre@comune.milano.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"9.30","time_to":"19.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["th"],"time_from":"9.30","time_to":"22.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705a17694d61f4c9cf0000/padiglione_darte_contemporanea_di_milano.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5552156f694d6103faa30100","distance":26,"time_walk":31,"time_bike":16},{"id":"5550c8ae694d6103fa3a0000","distance":176,"time_walk":212,"time_bike":106},{"id":"5551fe27694d6103fa2b0100","distance":233,"time_walk":281,"time_bike":140},{"id":"5551c1e1694d6103faaf0000","distance":234,"time_walk":282,"time_bike":141},{"id":"554b2c97694d61267ecc0000","distance":250,"time_walk":301,"time_bike":151},{"id":"554b2864694d61267ebc0000","distance":258,"time_walk":311,"time_bike":155},{"id":"554b4583694d61267e530100","distance":281,"time_walk":339,"time_bike":169},{"id":"5549ebe8694d61267e620000","distance":293,"time_walk":353,"time_bike":177},{"id":"5550cd59694d6103fa570000","distance":345,"time_walk":416,"time_bike":208},{"id":"5549eac9694d61267e5c0000","distance":345,"time_walk":416,"time_bike":208}]},{"id":"554b7c0d694d6147f8070000","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Basilica di Sant'Eufemia","description":"The Basilica di Sant'Eufemia is located in central Milan, in the namesake piazza, along Corso Italia.

The building’s exterior follows the Neoromanesque style, whereas its interior is in Neogothic style and is composed by three distinct sections: the 1800s avant-corps, the nave, and the apse. The church was rebuilt during the 15th century and subsequently adapted in the following centuries, thanks also to the contributions of important patrons. It was in this church that in 1564 was baptised Federigo Borromeo, nephew of Saint Charles Borromeo, and future archbishop of Milan. In 1870, the architect Enrico Terzaghi created the current tall central hall, eliminating the three spans. For static reasons, the church was lengthened by a span, and, therefore, the façade was redone.","tips":"In the 1950s, the Basilica, thanks to its excellent acoustics, was used of the EMI record company as a recording studio: here the soprano Maria Callas recorded I Puritani and Cavalleria rusticana in 1953, and La sonnambula in 1957.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza S.

According to tradition, the carriage in which Saint Eustorgius transported the relics of the Magi from Constantinople stopped inexplicably: the wheels had become heavy as boulders and neither oxen nor horses could move them. Thus Eustorgius had to renounce the idea of bringing the remains of the Magi to the Santa Tecla basilica and had a new basilica built instead. In 1162, during the sack of Milan by Barbarossa’s troops, the relic were stolen and brought to the Cathedral of Cologne. In 1904, they were returned in part, and they are currently kept in a reliquary near the sarcophagus of the Magi, inside the Basilica di Sant’Eustorgio. Although the original façade of the basilica dating back to the 12th century, the current one is the result of a restoration in Neoromanesque style. The bell tower, which stands in the back of the church, hosts a concert of six bells. On its summit is placed an eight-point star, which symbolises the star that guided the Magi to Bethlehem. The church interior is partitioned into three naves surmounted by a cross vault.","tips":"The bell tower of the Basilica di Sant’Eustorgio hosted the first public clock in Italy.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Sant'Eustorgio","street_number":"1","coordinates":["45.45349","9.18103"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0258101583","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.santeustorgio.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":" parrocchia@santeustorgio.it","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5570524f694d61f4c9790000/basilica_di_sant_eustorgio.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5551c806694d6103fad60000","distance":122,"time_walk":147,"time_bike":73},{"id":"5550d260694d6103fa6a0000","distance":126,"time_walk":152,"time_bike":76},{"id":"5550ca52694d6103fa460000","distance":271,"time_walk":327,"time_bike":163},{"id":"5550c476694d6103fa230000","distance":300,"time_walk":361,"time_bike":181},{"id":"554b803a694d6147f83c0000","distance":437,"time_walk":527,"time_bike":263},{"id":"55520217694d6103fa480100","distance":492,"time_walk":593,"time_bike":296},{"id":"554b890d694d6147f8540000","distance":524,"time_walk":631,"time_bike":316},{"id":"554b7dd5694d6147f8210000","distance":626,"time_walk":754,"time_bike":377},{"id":"554b897e694d6147f85a0000","distance":640,"time_walk":771,"time_bike":386},{"id":"554b7c0d694d6147f8070000","distance":668,"time_walk":805,"time_bike":402}]},{"id":"554b7cc1694d6147f80f0000","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Certosa di Garegnano","description":"The Certosa di Garegnano is a monastery on the north-western outskirts of Milan.

The attack took place on the night of August 13th, 1943, with the drop of bombs that set the building on fire and, according to the texts that provide the best accounts of these events, affected mostly the central section of the building, the honour courtyard, and the Merlo grand staircase, which was completely destroyed by the collapse of the vault above it.","tips":"Palazzo Litta hosts the Teatro Litta, the oldest functioning theatre in Milan.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Corso Magenta","street_number":"24","coordinates":["45.46585","9.17833"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"028055882","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"info@teatrolitta.it","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.teatrolitta.it","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55719dc8694d61043a010000/palazzo_litta.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b8b24694d6147f8670000","distance":41,"time_walk":49,"time_bike":25},{"id":"5551ccc6694d6103fafe0000","distance":41,"time_walk":49,"time_bike":25},{"id":"554b4474694d61267e4a0100","distance":52,"time_walk":63,"time_bike":31},{"id":"5549e3a7694d61267e340000","distance":200,"time_walk":241,"time_bike":120},{"id":"555b41fc694d6103facd0200","distance":234,"time_walk":282,"time_bike":141},{"id":"55535eda694d6103fa610200","distance":260,"time_walk":313,"time_bike":157},{"id":"55536acf694d6103fa830200","distance":308,"time_walk":371,"time_bike":186},{"id":"5549da0b694d61267e0d0000","distance":338,"time_walk":407,"time_bike":204},{"id":"5552136c694d6103faa00100","distance":338,"time_walk":407,"time_bike":204},{"id":"5549e224694d61267e2b0000","distance":397,"time_walk":478,"time_bike":239}]},{"id":"554b326a694d61267eed0000","type":"Buildings","name":"Palazzo Mezzanotte","description":"Palazzo Mezzanotte, also known as Palazzo della Borsa, is located in Piazza degli Affari.

The Palazzo, which covers a total area of 6,450 square metres, was inaugurated in October 1932. It was a cutting-edge building for Italy at the time: it was the first to boast an automatic implementation of simultaneous calls of the lifts, it had an air conditioning system based on the use of water and steam, and it hosted the largest illuminated electric display that enabled the real-time visualisation of the prices of the 78 stocks traded at the exchange.

A stream called Acualunga used to flow through the garden all the way to the city neighbourhood of Precotto, and as it approached the edges of the estate, passed under the Martesana Canal. During the second half of the 19th century, the new owner of the Villa, Fanny Finzi Ottolenghi, destined the park to humanitarian causes. She had a ‘garden-house for Gorla’s children’ built. Subsequently, in the early 1900s, she also had a shelter for disabled children built, in collaboration with the orthopaedic institute Gaetano Pini.

The monumental central portal divides the main façade into two equal parts, almost 300m long, which looks onto Via Festa del Perdono. The oldest part is the right wing, built in the fifteenth century. Its construction was begun by Filarete, to whom we owe the arcades with round arches resting on stone columns and raised on a high pedestal. When he died, the project was continued by the brothers Guiniforte and Francesco Solari, who created the terracotta decorations on the upper floors. The main entrance opens directly onto the vast central courtyard built by Richini in the Baroque style. The two western cloisters (‘della Farmacia’ and ‘dei Bagni’) have preserved their original form and were built under the direction of Filarete in the 1460s.","tips":"Today it is home to the Università degli Studi di Milano.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Festa del Perdono","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.46074","9.19415"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5570529b694d61f4c97c0000/ca_granda.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b6ed9694d61267e6f0100","distance":73,"time_walk":88,"time_bike":44},{"id":"5550c778694d6103fa300000","distance":148,"time_walk":178,"time_bike":89},{"id":"5549da64694d61267e120000","distance":210,"time_walk":253,"time_bike":127},{"id":"555c6930694d6103faee0200","distance":221,"time_walk":266,"time_bike":133},{"id":"554b701b694d61267e800100","distance":257,"time_walk":310,"time_bike":155},{"id":"554b7d80694d6147f81d0000","distance":267,"time_walk":322,"time_bike":161},{"id":"554b3360694d61267ef90000","distance":290,"time_walk":349,"time_bike":175},{"id":"554b8b67694d6147f86b0000","distance":292,"time_walk":352,"time_bike":176},{"id":"55535f90694d6103fa6d0200","distance":300,"time_walk":361,"time_bike":181},{"id":"5549ee73694d61267e740000","distance":349,"time_walk":420,"time_bike":210}]},{"id":"554b43cd694d61267e470100","type":"Palaces and Castles","name":"Casa Campanini","description":"Casa Campanini was built between 1904 and 1906 by the architect Alfredo Campanini.

The house was built on the ruins of the recently demolished Spanish Walls. It is one of the major achievements of the Milanese Liberty style. If Liberty was the expression of an emerging middle class, eager to stand out from the nobility, this was not the primary objective in the case of Casa Laugier.

A previous church dating back to 1288 already stood in the same site. After the death in 1444 of the great preacher from Siena Saint Bernardino, who had been in Milan several times, it was decided to build this new church dedicated to him. The term Alle Monache (at the nuns) was added to the church name because it had been built for the extensive monastery and to distinguish it from the church of San Bernardino alle Ossa, at the Verziere market. In 1645, a new wing with a Baroque façade was built at the behest of mother superior, sister Maria Antonia Galimberti. In 1727 the church’s portal and windows were modified. About fifty years later, in 1782, the convent was abolished, and the buildings that were part of it progressively demolished. When the current seat of the Liceo Manzoni school was built in 1913, the 1600s wing of the church too was destroyed.

In the church is housed a square chapel–ossuary, whose walls are covered by skulls and bones, which are laid out in various shapes, some of them geometric.

The church was modified numerous times over the centuries, starting with the addition of two bell towers in the 12th century.

Following the initial Renaissance model, on either side of the façade, which is decorated by bas-reliefs, rise two bell towers. The lower section of the façade, which is punctuated by stone columns and engaged columns that hold the massive cornice, was built before 1620. The section above it, light and undulating, was instead realised in the early 1700s in the Lombard Rococo style. The structure of the two bell towers is considered one of the most shining anticipating examples of the renowned façade of the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, which is the work of Francesco Borromini.

In the church interior is a single nave covered by a barrel vault with four chapels per side. In the nave are found traces of the original decorations from the 1600s: the band painted with puttos and festoons, and, in the under-arch of the third left-hand chapel, stucco and tempera medallions with the Joyous Mysteries and other scenes of the life of the Virgin Mary.","tips":"On the floor, halfway through the nave, is found a perforated stone.

This tympanum, which adorns the fine Baroque façade alternating Corinthian and Ionic orders, protects the fine high-relief created in 1670 by Carlo Simonetta portraying The Assumption of the Virgin Mary. During the night between August 12th and August 13th of 1943, the church was hit hard by a Second World War allied bombardment: three high-power bombs destroyed the Cappella della Madonna, erected in 1704 and later utilised as baptistery, the building to the left of the church, and the group of buildings to the right of it.

Visible from the street, in the more modern section of the church, are a courtyard with a trapezoidal plan and, further inside, a 1500s cloister with porticos.","tips":"In 1996, this church was given in use to the Romanian Orthodox community.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via De Amicis","street_number":"11","coordinates":["45.45738","9.18018"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705675694d61f4c9a70000/chiesa_di_santa_maria_della_vittoria.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5550c476694d6103fa230000","distance":139,"time_walk":167,"time_bike":84},{"id":"554b7dd5694d6147f8210000","distance":226,"time_walk":272,"time_bike":136},{"id":"5550ca52694d6103fa460000","distance":239,"time_walk":288,"time_bike":144},{"id":"555326d0694d6103fa140200","distance":256,"time_walk":308,"time_bike":154},{"id":"5551c806694d6103fad60000","distance":327,"time_walk":394,"time_bike":197},{"id":"5554c120694d6103faad0200","distance":370,"time_walk":446,"time_bike":223},{"id":"5551d2e7694d6103fa0e0100","distance":397,"time_walk":478,"time_bike":239},{"id":"554b7bc8694d6147f8010000","distance":437,"time_walk":527,"time_bike":263},{"id":"555c9def694d6103faf70200","distance":494,"time_walk":595,"time_bike":298},{"id":"554b7cf7694d6147f8150000","distance":505,"time_walk":608,"time_bike":304}]},{"id":"555c4439694d6103fadf0200","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di Santa Maria Podone","description":"The church of Santa Maria Podone is one of Milan’s oldest, as it was founded during the ninth century. According to an ancient parchment from the year 871, it was already consecrated by that year. The church owes its name to the fact that the ground on which it was built was donated by a nobleman by the name of Vuerolfo known as Pedone or Podone, son of Ercmario from Milano. Over the centuries, it has been modified many times, for instance, the chapel was added only in 1440, at the behest of the Borromeos, and the bell tower, the work of Pellegrino Tibaldi, was built during the 1500s. The Baroque gabled façade is the work of Fabio Mangone, who realised it between 1628 and 1634. The façade is bordered on both sides by two pairs of robust pilasters with Corinthian capitals, each of which has at its centre a rectangular window with a marble frame. The church interior, which was originally composed of three naves, each of which ended in a semicircular apse, keeps its structure intact, although successive restorations have given it its current Baroque appearance.","tips":"Since October 13th, 2012, this building houses the Orthodox Church of Italy.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Borromeo","street_number":"6","coordinates":["45.46338","9.18242"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5576f3c76d697207110d0000/chiesa_di_santa_maria_podone.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5549e224694d61267e2b0000","distance":24,"time_walk":29,"time_bike":14},{"id":"55535e80694d6103fa5b0200","distance":169,"time_walk":204,"time_bike":102},{"id":"554b326a694d61267eed0000","distance":169,"time_walk":204,"time_bike":102},{"id":"5549e338694d61267e310000","distance":217,"time_walk":261,"time_bike":131},{"id":"555c666a694d6103faea0200","distance":235,"time_walk":283,"time_bike":142},{"id":"555b41fc694d6103facd0200","distance":238,"time_walk":287,"time_bike":143},{"id":"554b313d694d61267ee40000","distance":254,"time_walk":306,"time_bike":153},{"id":"554b7cf7694d6147f8150000","distance":286,"time_walk":345,"time_bike":172},{"id":"5551d2e7694d6103fa0e0100","distance":291,"time_walk":351,"time_bike":175},{"id":"55530f60694d6103fac80100","distance":292,"time_walk":352,"time_bike":176}]},{"id":"554b890d694d6147f8540000","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Chiesa di Santa Maria presso San Celso","description":"Began in 1493, at the height of the Renaissance, by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and Giovanni Battagio, the church of Santa Maria presso San Celso was meant to house a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary.

This church was one of the first buildings in Milan to be fully in Renaissance style. On a design by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, in 1506 was added to the original plan a longitudinal body with a single nave, which was covered by a monumental coffered barrel vault and side chapels.

The bas-reliefs by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, which used to be part of it, are now preserved in the Museo d'Arte Antica del Castello Sforzesco. Starting in 1870, the architect Vandoni extended the current front in Neorenaissance style. The central section is partitioned into two horizontal bands, on which is superimposed a cornice; each of the two bands is partitioned into three sectors by Corinthian pilasters. In the centre of the lower band is located the slightly splayed portal, and, on its either sides, two round single-lancet windows.

The columns were moved to the current location to complete the newly built Basilica di San Lorenzo. The capitals, however, come from two different buildings - they are different in style and size. A brick spacer was added to the lower capitals to level them with the others.

The statues that decorate the interior are by the Milanese sculptor Pietro Magni. Heavily damaged during the British bombing of August 1943, the gallery was rebuilt after the war.

It is an enclosed public area of about 4,000 square metres, and it is all that remains of a historic garden dating back to the 1700s, which belonged to the Perego family from the town of Cremnago. The original garden was designed by Luigi Canonica: it had straight walkways and, at its centre, a big Neogothic-style greenhouse and a fishpond. It was Canonica himself who redesigned it a few years later to make it conform more to the English style, the style we recognise today. Beginning in the mid-1800s, with the construction of the first Stazione Centrale (central railway station) and, in the 20th century, of the current one, traffic problems arose for linking Porta Nuova with the city centre. As a consequence, new streets were opened, and, in 1940, a compromise was struck between the city administration and the Peregos: a long section of the park would become today’s Via dei Giardini, and the park’s northern section, now isolated, would become public. The relevant construction works were completed in 1941.","tips":"The Giardino Perego is rich in children’s attractions, and there is even a 200-metre jogging ring. Bicycles are admitted to it, as long as they are ridden at a reasonable speed. Within the park is also a 1700s statue of Vertumnus, the god of gardens and fruit trees of Roman mythology. This statue is the only one left in the site by the Peregos, out of the many that once adorned the grounds of their estate.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via dei Giardini","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.47211","9.19219"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[{"date_from":"1/11","date_to":"28/02","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"19.00"},{"date_from":"1/03","date_to":"31/04","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"20.00"},{"date_from":"1/05","date_to":"30/09","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"22.00"},{"date_from":"1/10","date_to":"31/10","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"21.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/55705873694d61f4c9c00000/giardino_perego.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5549ef27694d61267e780000","distance":165,"time_walk":199,"time_bike":99},{"id":"5551c58f694d6103fac20000","distance":190,"time_walk":229,"time_bike":114},{"id":"555afeed694d6103fac50200","distance":194,"time_walk":234,"time_bike":117},{"id":"5562ea3d694d619302290000","distance":236,"time_walk":284,"time_bike":142},{"id":"5550c659694d6103fa2a0000","distance":306,"time_walk":369,"time_bike":184},{"id":"5551c6ae694d6103facb0000","distance":332,"time_walk":400,"time_bike":200},{"id":"554b254d694d61267ea60000","distance":332,"time_walk":400,"time_bike":200},{"id":"5551cf11694d6103fa040100","distance":340,"time_walk":410,"time_bike":205},{"id":"55520521694d6103fa590100","distance":340,"time_walk":410,"time_bike":205},{"id":"554b4583694d61267e530100","distance":357,"time_walk":430,"time_bike":215}]},{"id":"5550c932694d6103fa430000","type":"Buildings","name":"Grattacielo Pirelli","description":"The Pirelli Tower, commonly known as the Pirellone, stands at the southwest corner of Piazza Duca d'Aosta.

In 1978, the skyscraper was purchased by the region of Lombardy to act as its administrative headquarters and underwent renovation by the architect Bob Noorda.

Over the years, the Triennial has taken on the role of championing the innovative Italian cultural environment, as well as providing a space for discourse and mutual development.

Rosa, daughter of the prince Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, hailed from a highly cultured aristocratic family, who were in close contact with the best minds of Milan’s Neoclassicism and poets like Vincenzo Monti and Giuseppe Parini. Following the death of her husband in 1833, she took over the education of their son, who had been born in 1822, and who grew up amidst the intellectuals of the time and amidst the arts, which his mother cultivated by expanding the already sizeable family collection. Always sensitive to the contributions of artists and thinkers from across Europe, who he often hosted, Gian Giacomo’s interests ranged from armoury to painting, from fabrics and tapestry, to glasses and ceramics, from goldsmith’s art to applied arts.","tips":"This museum is part of the Case Museo di Milano circuit, and it has on display works of a number of artists, such as: Perugino, Piero della Francesca, Sandro Botticelli, Antonio Pollaiolo, Giovanni Bellini, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Pinturicchio, Filippo Lippi, Andrea Mantegna, Jacopo Palma il Vecchio, Francesco Hayez, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Jusepe de Ribera, Canaletto, Lucas Cranach il Vecchio, and Luca Giordano.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":20,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":2,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Alessandro Manzoni","street_number":"12","coordinates":["45.46848","9.19153"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"10.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"7.0","recipients":[null,null,null]},{"type":"Scolaresche","description":"","price":"2.5","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"02794889","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.museopoldipezzoli.it","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"ferraris@museopoldipezzoli.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"10.00","time_to":"18.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/557059e0694d61f4c9cc0000/museo_poldi_pezzoli.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b414b694d61267e290100","distance":33,"time_walk":40,"time_bike":20},{"id":"554b237d694d61267e9a0000","distance":50,"time_walk":60,"time_bike":30},{"id":"5549f10d694d61267e7c0000","distance":133,"time_walk":160,"time_bike":80},{"id":"55520f60694d6103fa920100","distance":161,"time_walk":194,"time_bike":97},{"id":"5549e4fc694d61267e3a0000","distance":164,"time_walk":198,"time_bike":99},{"id":"55520db8694d6103fa880100","distance":172,"time_walk":207,"time_bike":104},{"id":"554b30a7694d61267ee10000","distance":172,"time_walk":207,"time_bike":104},{"id":"55536af8694d6103fa860200","distance":172,"time_walk":207,"time_bike":104},{"id":"554b2598694d61267eb10000","distance":172,"time_walk":207,"time_bike":104},{"id":"5549e40a694d61267e370000","distance":180,"time_walk":217,"time_bike":108}]},{"id":"55545c75694d6103fa930200","type":"Villas, Gardens and Parks","name":"Palazzina Liberty","description":"Milan’s Palazzina Liberty is an Art Nouveau (stile liberty, in Italian) building located within Vittorio Formentano Park.

The most demanding intervention of this embellishment campaign took place in the 1740s, with the commission of the fresco of the Galleria degli Arazzi to the most highly regarded artist of the time, Giambattista Tiepolo. The fresco was realised following a long planning phase, which is testified by the numerous studies that have in part survived until today. The complexity of this work was partly due the layout of the room, which is narrow but extremely long (5 metres in width by 22 metres in length).

The building is characterised by spacious courtyards and functional and modern interiors.

The project was entrusted to Luca Beltrami, one of the most prominent Milanese architects of the time. In terms of form, Beltrami was inspired by the Neoclassicism of Teatro alla Scala. This was not a choice made at random: the classical style, more so than the Liberty architecture in fashion at the time, confers a seriousness and grandiosity well-suited to the headquarters of a bank.

On the ceiling of the first floor’s Sala da Ballo (ballroom) can be found a grandiose painting by Tiepolo (painted in 1731–1732), where mythological figures sway in a clear sky and narrate the vicissitudes of Scipio and Massinissa.

The famous ‘Sala d’Oro’ designed by Gerolamo Arganini and decorated by Giacomo Tazzini was modernized for the wedding of Ferdinand I.

In 2003, the Giardino dei Giusti (‘Garden of the Just’) was dedicated to opponents of genocide and crimes against humanity.","tips":"In the Eighties, artificial snow was used to host a slalom tournament featuring Ski World Cup champions.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Cimabue","street_number":"40","coordinates":["45.48922","9.13726"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5571a0b2694d61043a170000/parco_monte_stella.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"55531c0f694d6103faf60100","distance":553,"time_walk":666,"time_bike":333},{"id":"5562e3db694d619302150000","distance":906,"time_walk":1092,"time_bike":546},{"id":"5562dee6694d619302080000","distance":1257,"time_walk":1514,"time_bike":757},{"id":"554b7cc1694d6147f80f0000","distance":1609,"time_walk":1939,"time_bike":969},{"id":"55531b3b694d6103faf30100","distance":1901,"time_walk":2290,"time_bike":1145},{"id":"5559b9dd694d6103fab00200","distance":1966,"time_walk":2369,"time_bike":1184},{"id":"554b3e80694d61267e1b0100","distance":2432,"time_walk":2930,"time_bike":1465},{"id":"5550c12a694d6103fa110000","distance":2505,"time_walk":3018,"time_bike":1509},{"id":"55531adc694d6103faf00100","distance":2795,"time_walk":3367,"time_bike":1684},{"id":"5550bf85694d6103fa0e0000","distance":3044,"time_walk":3667,"time_bike":1834}]},{"id":"55531adc694d6103faf00100","type":"Villas, Gardens and Parks","name":"Parco Pallavicino","description":"Parco Pallavicino was built in the 1960s on land previously occupied by the westbound railway line and the Sempione rail yard closed in 1934.

Inside the square had originally been erected one of the many votive columns that were built in Milan during the plague of 1576. Subsequently, in 1624, in the square was erected a statue of Saint Charles Borromeo, which was moved in 1786 to Piazza Borromeo near the church of Santa Maria Podone. It is said that this decision was made by the then Austrian Governor, who justified his choice with the statue’s “hindrance to circulation”, after he had crashed on it with his carriage.

This square has been cited by many Italian media outlets for the so-called Cattelan’s Finger, a sculpture standing at its centre. This work portrays a hand extended in the Fascist salute, but its fingers have been chopped — as if eroded by time — except for the middle finger, so as to portray visually the gesture of the lifted middle finger, which is deemed obscene.

In the new square was an extensive central garden, about which ran the station-bound carriage and tram traffic. In 1931 the Stazione Centrale was closed and replaced by the current one, built about one kilometre further north; the square was, therefore, widened, both northward (over the area that was originally part of the station) and southward (over the area of the knocked down bastion), taking on today’s look.

Of the buildings that originally edged the square, only the archbishopric has been preserved, after all the others where destroyed or gutted during and immediately after the Second World War. The Palazzo del Capitano di Giustizia, built in the 1500s, which now serves as wing of the eastern side of the square, used to be separated from the square by a block of buildings, which were eventually demolished. Previously, most of the area of the square was occupied by a fruit and vegetable market (Verziere), which was transferred to a nearby area, to the current Via Verziere. Piermarini’s makeover of the piazza also involved the significant transformation of the archbishopric façade, on which were created wide window shapes that had the purpose of lightening up the façade’s ponderous appearance.","tips":"On December 12th, 1969, in this square was perpetrated the massacre of Piazza Fontana (la strage di Piazza Fontana).

In everyday language, Piazza Mercanti is intended to mean the square delimited by the Palazzo della Ragione, the Casa dei Panigarola, and the Loggia degli Osii. This square was created during the middle of the 13th century. It had a rectangular layout and was originally larger than it is today. The square had six accesses, corresponding to the city’s six districts (sestieri). The adjacent streets were named after the trades that were performed within them: Armorari (armourers), Spadari (sword makers), Cappellari (hatters), Orefici (goldsmiths), Speronari (spur makers), Fustagnari (moleskin makers). On orders of the Podestà Oldrado da Tresseno, at the centre of the square was built the Palazzo della Ragione, also known as Broletto Nuovo. The building was completed in 1233 to become the seat of judicial activities, and it gave the square the name of Piazza del Broletto in medieval times.","tips":"Between 1944 and 1951, Piazza Mercanti hosted the provisional seat of the notorious department store, La Rinascente, after the store branch of Piazza Duomo was destroyed by bombardments.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":2,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Mercanti","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.46458","9.18772"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5571a1f5694d61043a260000/piazza_mercanti.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"554b34d9694d61267eff0000","distance":0,"time_walk":0,"time_bike":0},{"id":"5549db24694d61267e220000","distance":0,"time_walk":0,"time_bike":0},{"id":"554b33b2694d61267efc0000","distance":0,"time_walk":0,"time_bike":0},{"id":"5549e89c694d61267e520000","distance":0,"time_walk":0,"time_bike":0},{"id":"5549e5b1694d61267e3d0000","distance":65,"time_walk":78,"time_bike":39},{"id":"554b8ccb694d6147f8780000","distance":120,"time_walk":145,"time_bike":72},{"id":"55535f3c694d6103fa670200","distance":123,"time_walk":148,"time_bike":74},{"id":"55530f60694d6103fac80100","distance":157,"time_walk":189,"time_bike":95},{"id":"554b8ab7694d6147f8630000","distance":163,"time_walk":196,"time_bike":98},{"id":"5551b861694d6103fa8d0000","distance":168,"time_walk":202,"time_bike":101}]},{"id":"55536acf694d6103fa830200","type":"Squares and Streets","name":"Piazza Sant'Ambrogio","description":"Piazza Sant'Ambrogio is the square in which stands the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio, after which the piazza is named.

Just these barracks eventually ‘swallowed’ the entire Franciscan Convent, which dates back to the 14th century.

The library too had collected a series of paintings portraying scholars and learned men from the classical world, as well as from the Christian culture, and it housed drawings and illuminated manuscripts: in 1637, Galeazzo Arconati donated to the Biblioteca Leonardo’s manuscripts that are now found at the Institut de France (after Napoleon’s plundering, the only such manuscript collection left today in the Biblioteca is the Codice Atlantico). Another treasure of the Biblioteca is the manuscript containing the works of Virgil owned by Petrarch (with comments added by the latter), which includes a miniature by Simone Martini.

Located to the northeast of the city, it used to be on the road that led to the town of Gorgonzola. The gate stands at the centre of Piazza Oberdan, in correspondence of its intersection with Corso Venezia. Toward the end of the 18th century, Porta Venezia became the first of the city gates to be considered for — then subjected to — a radical transformation to acquire a monumental appearance. The architect appointed for this task was Giuseppe Piermarini. At the time, the gate, much like the nearby section of the bastions, had lost any defence purposes, and it was only utilised to collect customs duties. The current tollhouse complex that makes up Porta Venezia is in Neoclassical style, and it was realised between 1827 and 1828 on a design by the architect from Brescia Rodolfo Vantini, following a competition advertised in 1826, to which responded 32 participants.

The porch is dominated by two orders of balustraded loggias - one with Tuscan columns, the other Corinthian capitals.","tips":"The entire villa was originally painted with frescoes depicting the exploits of the House of Gonzaga, of which only a few fragments remain.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":5,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":" Via Stilicone","street_number":"36","coordinates":["45.49111","9.16834"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/5571a530694d61043a3d0000/villa_simonetta.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"55520b30694d6103fa800100","distance":882,"time_walk":1063,"time_bike":531},{"id":"55531c82694d6103faf90100","distance":1128,"time_walk":1359,"time_bike":680},{"id":"55531b3b694d6103faf30100","distance":1149,"time_walk":1384,"time_bike":692},{"id":"5550c2eb694d6103fa190000","distance":1159,"time_walk":1396,"time_bike":698},{"id":"554b7ecf694d6147f82d0000","distance":1554,"time_walk":1872,"time_bike":936},{"id":"5550bf85694d6103fa0e0000","distance":1669,"time_walk":2011,"time_bike":1005},{"id":"5562e04f694d6193020f0000","distance":1820,"time_walk":2193,"time_bike":1096},{"id":"55535eae694d6103fa5e0200","distance":1846,"time_walk":2224,"time_bike":1112},{"id":"5550d18f694d6103fa610000","distance":1851,"time_walk":2230,"time_bike":1115},{"id":"554b888d694d6147f84e0000","distance":1893,"time_walk":2281,"time_bike":1140}]},{"id":"555208a1694d6103fa750100","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"WOW Spazio Fumetto","description":"WOW Spazio Fumetto Milan is a museum dedicated to comics, illustration and animation, created and managed by the Fondazione Franco Fossati and opened in 2011.
