Two of the towers, although restored, still testify to this original nucleus. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the gate was used as a fortified stronghold in the defences of the city. In 1637 the regent for Duke Charles Emmanuel II, Christine Marie of France, chose it as her personal residence. She commissioned the covering of the court and a revamping of the inner apartments. Sixty years later another regent, Marie Jeanne of Savoy, lived in the palace, conferring upon it definitively the nickname of Madama (Italian for Madame). She asked architect Filippo Juvarra to design a new Baroque palace in white stone, but the works halted in 1721 after only the front section had been completed. Later the palace had various uses, and housed the headquarters of the provisional French government during the Napoleonic Wars. In the 19th century King Charles Albert selected it as seat of the Pinacoteca Regia, the Royal Art gallery, and, later, of the Subalpine Senate (the Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia) and of the High Court.","tips":"It was the first Senate of the Italian Kingdom, and takes its traditional name from the embellishments it received under two queens (madama) of the House of Savoy.","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Madama,_Turin","visit_time":60,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":2,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Castello","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.07098","7.6859"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"10.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"+39 011 4433501","description":""},{"type":"website","value":"http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/it","description":""},{"type":"email","value":"palazzomadama@fondazionetorinomusei.it","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"10:00.00","time_to":"18:00.00"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["su"],"time_from":"10:00.00","time_to":"19:00.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb1f8f3273301565000746/palazzo_madama.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"568fe82b327330156500049d","distance":90,"time_walk":108,"time_bike":54},{"id":"565dcb233273301565000189","distance":98,"time_walk":118,"time_bike":59},{"id":"565f2a453273301565000233","distance":132,"time_walk":159,"time_bike":80},{"id":"56977b663273301565000617","distance":149,"time_walk":180,"time_bike":90},{"id":"565efa3232733015650001ff","distance":159,"time_walk":192,"time_bike":96},{"id":"5697d9033273301565000648","distance":181,"time_walk":218,"time_bike":109},{"id":"5698d566327330156500066e","distance":200,"time_walk":241,"time_bike":120},{"id":"565ebba332733015650001b2","distance":209,"time_walk":252,"time_bike":126},{"id":"5695323b32733015650005de","distance":212,"time_walk":255,"time_bike":128},{"id":"569785ca3273301565000630","distance":214,"time_walk":258,"time_bike":129}]},{"id":"565d7bf032733015650000d5","type":"Arches, Gates and Walls","name":"Palatine Towers","description":"The Palatine Gate is a Roman Age city gate located in Turin, Italy.

Built as a royal hunting lodge in the early 18th century. The original castle was owned by the Acaja line of the House of Savoy, Lords of Piedmont until 1418, and was sold to marquis Rolando Pallavicino in 1493. It was then acquired by Emmanuel Philibert in 1563, when the ducal capital was moved from ChambÃ©ry to Turin. The new palace was designed by the architect Filippo Juvarra to be used as hunting lodge for Victor Amadeus II, King of Sardinia. Works started in 1729. Within two years construction was far enough advanced for the first formal hunt to take place.\r\nJuvarra called upon a team of decorators, many of them from Venice, to carry out the decor of the palazzina interiors. In the reigns of Carlo Emanuele III and Victor Amadeus III the palazzina and its formal park continued to be extended, at first by Juvarra's assistant, Giovanni Tommaso Prunotto, then by numerous North Italian architects, such as Ignazio Birago di Borgaro, Ludovico Bo, Ignazio Bertola and Benedetto Alfieri. The final building has a total of 137 rooms and 17 galleries, and covers 31,050 square meters.\r\nToday the Palace of Stupinigi houses the museum of the arts and furnishings, some original to the palazzina, others brought from the former Savoia residences of Moncalieri and Venaria Reale.

The ancient castle was bought by Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy on the advice of Andrea Palladio. The name Valentino, first mentioned in 1275, seems to derive from a saint called Valentine whose relics were venerated in a church which stood nearby. The current structure is due to Princess Christine Marie of France (1606â€“1663), wife of Victor Amadeus I, who dwelt here from 1630. It has a horseshoe shape, with four round towers at each angle, and a wide inner court with a marble pavement. The ceilings of the false upper floors are clearly in transalpino (i.e. French) style. The faÃ§ade sports a huge coat of arms of the House of Savoy.

The Jewish community of Turin had enjoyed full civil rights since 1848, and at the time the construction of the synagogue began, Turin was the capital of the new Italian state, a position it held only from 1860 to 1864. The relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not happy. He proposed a series of modifications which raised the final height to 167.5 meters, over 46 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869, with a provisional roof.\r\nWith the removal of the Italian capital to Florence in 1864, the community shrank, but costs and Antonelli's ambition continued to rise. In 1876, the Jewish community, which had spent 692,000 lire for a building that was still far from finished, announced that it was withdrawing from the project. The people of Turin, who had watched the synagogue rise skyward, demanded that the city take over the project, which it did. Since 2000, the building has housed the Museo Nazionale del Cinema (National Museum of Cinema). The Mole appears on the reverse of the two-cent Italian euro coins and was the inspiration for the official emblem of the 2006 Winter Olympic","tips":"","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Antonelliana","visit_time":90,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":2,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Montebello ","street_number":"20","coordinates":["45.06902","7.69291"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"10.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"3.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Free","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"7.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Free","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"14.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"11.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"website","value":"http://www.museocinema.it/","description":""},{"type":"phone","value":"+39 011 8138 560 / 561","description":""},{"type":"phone","value":"+39 011 8138 517","description":""},{"type":"email","value":"prenotazioni@museocinema.it","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","we","th","fr","su"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"20.00"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["sa"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"23.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb045b32733015650006ce/mole_antonelliana.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5697c4a03273301565000638","distance":289,"time_walk":348,"time_bike":174},{"id":"5693dadc3273301565000552","distance":289,"time_walk":348,"time_bike":174},{"id":"5673efb4327330156500034c","distance":299,"time_walk":360,"time_bike":180},{"id":"56951b5032733015650005ba","distance":324,"time_walk":390,"time_bike":195},{"id":"565edd4d32733015650001fc","distance":348,"time_walk":419,"time_bike":210},{"id":"567980f032733015650003f0","distance":382,"time_walk":460,"time_bike":230},{"id":"567977d932733015650003bb","distance":387,"time_walk":466,"time_bike":233},{"id":"56781b3c327330156500039f","distance":405,"time_walk":488,"time_bike":244},{"id":"568feb2732733015650004a4","distance":462,"time_walk":557,"time_bike":278},{"id":"565f2a453273301565000233","distance":473,"time_walk":570,"time_bike":285}]},{"id":"565f06a8327330156500020b","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Modern Art Gallery","description":"The first core of the Gallery was part of the civic museum instituted in 1863, who had also got the antique works of art later converged at the Palazzo Madama museum\r\nDemolished during World War II, the actual location was designed by Carlo Boschetti and Goffredo Bassi, inaugurated in 1959, later renewed and enlarged during the last restoration (1981-1993).

This fulfilled a vow the duke (and future King of Sardinia) had made during the Battle of Turin, after defeating the besieging French army within the War of the Spanish Succession. The architect alluded to earlier styles while adding a baroque touch. The church contains the tombs of many princes and kings of the House of Savoy, including the Monument to Carlo Emanuele III (1733) by Ignazio Collino and his brother Filippo. Under the church are the tombs of the Savoy family, including most of its members (among them, Charles Albert). This church by Juvarra is considered late Baroque-Classicism.","tips":"The history of the Church can be traced to September 2, 1706, when Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy and the Prince of Carignan Eugene of Savoy climbed the hill to see Turin besieged by Franco-Spanish forces during the War of the Spanish Succession. Victor Amadeus, having knelt down in front of an old prop, swore that, in case of victory, he would have a monument built to our Lady (the Virgin Mary). From dawn until the early hours of the afternoon of September 7 the armies clashed in the fields at Jaya and Madonna di Campagna. Piedmontese armies achieved victory over the French.

It is currently home to the Castello di Rivoli - Museo d'Arte Contemporanea, the museum of contemporary art of Turin. The castle was probably built in the 9th-10th centuries, but its existence is mentioned for the first time only in 1159, in a diplom by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa that ceded the Rivolese territories to the bishops of Turin.\r\nThe House of Savoy acquired Rivoli in the 11th century, and soon began a feud with the bishops that as soon as 1184 provoked damage to the castle. In 1330 Amadeus VI of Savoy moved in the castle the Consiglio dei Principi, senior administrative council of the countryside. The castle was also the first place of public veneration of the Shroud of Turin in his path towards Turin under Amadeus IX.\r\nAfter a period of decline, the Treaty of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis (1559) established that Duke Emmanuel Philibert could not reside in Turin until he had not a male child. He therefore set his residency in the Castle of Rivoli, having it restored by architect Ascanio Vitozzi. In 1562 heir Charles Emmanuel I was born, and he returned to Turin. Works on Vittozzi's designed were brought on until 1644 under Carlo and Amedeo di Castellamonte, with the construction of the so-called Manica Lunga, intended to house the Savoy Gallery, the sole 17th century part of the edifice still visible today. Numerous of the works of art were however stolen by French troops in the following years. New works began after 1706.\r\nVictor Amadeus lived here as a prisoner with his morganatic spouse the Marchesa di Spigno after his abdication and his failed attempt to regain the reign from his son Charles Emmanuel III. After his death, the castle was mostly abandoned; the edifice was heavily damaged during World War II, and remained in a substantial state of abandon until 1979, when new works of restoration were begun. In 1984 the castle was reopened as seat of the Museo di Arte Contemporanea","tips":"The castle also contains the Michelin-starred restaurant Combal.Zero.

It was a \"home-studio\" which favoured freedom of expression for creative talent. The building was designed to be an aesthetic model of the new style, during the age of Stile Liberty in Turin.\r\nAfter it was built in the 1900s, Pietro Fenoglio and his family left the house. They sold it to a French businessman named Lafleur, who lived there until his death. After Lafleur, the heirs left the whole house to La Benefica, an important orphanage and charity association in Turin. It was saved from bombing in the second world war. The building suffered years of decline but in the 1990s was sold to private clients who restored it carefully, giving back the original splendour. At the moment the building is partially appointed to private residence and offices. Although the structure is characterised by a rather traditional setting typical of a bourgeois, the building is an excellent and balanced example of combined use of materials. The decoration is very rich and references art nouveau with frequently phytomorphic shapes. The latter constitutes the elements between the two wings of the building and is embellished with a pronounced bow-window with polychrome glazing which exhibits a mixture of wrought iron. The winding trend is nicely presented in an elegant glass newsstand line above the balcony, which seems to reference the Parisian sinuosity of Hector Guimard's architecture.","tips":"","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Fenoglio-Lafleur","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Principi d'Acaja","street_number":"11","coordinates":["45.07657","7.66444"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb0d4d3273301565000704/casa_lafleur.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"56991b26327330156500069a","distance":165,"time_walk":199,"time_bike":99},{"id":"56991e4e327330156500069e","distance":253,"time_walk":305,"time_bike":152},{"id":"5667fdbb3273301565000268","distance":402,"time_walk":484,"time_bike":242},{"id":"5696271e32733015650005f4","distance":490,"time_walk":590,"time_bike":295},{"id":"569389ea32733015650004ab","distance":597,"time_walk":719,"time_bike":360},{"id":"569637f83273301565000608","distance":659,"time_walk":794,"time_bike":397},{"id":"5693c9f83273301565000522","distance":759,"time_walk":914,"time_bike":457},{"id":"5694cd21327330156500057a","distance":770,"time_walk":928,"time_bike":464},{"id":"5668006a3273301565000270","distance":788,"time_walk":949,"time_bike":475},{"id":"5693959c32733015650004d3","distance":907,"time_walk":1093,"time_bike":546}]},{"id":"565f0a9a3273301565000216","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Museum of Oriental Art","description":"The Museum of Oriental Art is a museum located in Palazzo Mazzonis which contains one of the most important oriental art collection in Italy.

Guarini designed a vast structure in the shape of a square; he had a straight and restrained east facade created and a lavish and very unusual elliptical tower, slightly is withdrawn in facade, on the west. Guarini also added a large forecourt at the centre of the palace. The building, constructed in brick in a typical Baroque style, has an elliptical center faÃ§ade. This facade offers the only domestic project to make use of the undulating 'concave â€“ convex â€“ concave' rhythm. From 1848 to 1861 the palace was used for the House of Deputies of the Subalpine Parliament. In 1861, with the creation of the parliament of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, the room became too small to host the House of Deputies, which was moved elsewhere.","tips":"The Palazzo was the birthplace of the future princesse de Lamballe in 1749 â€“ confidant of Marie Antoinette and for whom she lost her life for in 1792.

It was a sumptuously built seating 1,500 and with 139 boxes located on five tiers plus a gallery.\r\nHowever, the theatre was closed on royal order in 1792 and it became a warehouse. With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the Teatro Nazionale and finally, after Napoleon's ascent to Emperor, renamed again as the Teatro Imperiale. Napoleon's fall in 1814 saw the theatre returned to its original name, the Regio. In the following years the opera house went through several periods of financial crisis and it was taken over by the city in 1870.\r\nFollowing the 1936 fire, a national competition was launched to find an architect. However, due to the war and the overall financial situation, the foundation stone was laid on 25 September 1963. Even then, work did not start until September 1967 under architect Carlo Mollino.\r\nThe rebuilt theatre, with its striking contemporary interior design but hidden behind the original facade, was inaugurated on 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi's I Vespri Siciliani directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano.","tips":"","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Regio_(Turin)","visit_time":90,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Castello ","street_number":"215","coordinates":["45.07104","7.68759"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"6.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"8.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Free","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"website","value":"http://www.teatroregio.torino.it/","description":""},{"type":"phone","value":"+39 0118815557","description":""},{"type":"email","value":"info@teatroregio.torino.it","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr"],"time_from":"15:30.00","time_to":""},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["sa"],"time_from":"11.00","time_to":"15:45.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb21b7327330156500074a/teatro_regio.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"565d760132733015650000c7","distance":132,"time_walk":159,"time_bike":80},{"id":"565dcb233273301565000189","distance":135,"time_walk":163,"time_bike":81},{"id":"567980f032733015650003f0","distance":157,"time_walk":189,"time_bike":95},{"id":"568fe82b327330156500049d","distance":163,"time_walk":196,"time_bike":98},{"id":"567977d932733015650003bb","distance":182,"time_walk":219,"time_bike":110},{"id":"5697d9033273301565000648","distance":200,"time_walk":241,"time_bike":120},{"id":"565ebba332733015650001b2","distance":224,"time_walk":270,"time_bike":135},{"id":"56951b5032733015650005ba","distance":236,"time_walk":284,"time_bike":142},{"id":"56977b663273301565000617","distance":243,"time_walk":293,"time_bike":146},{"id":"5677ec973273301565000376","distance":260,"time_walk":313,"time_bike":157}]},{"id":"5673efb4327330156500034c","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Albertina Academy of Fine Arts","description":"The Accademia Albertina delle Belle Arti (\"Albertina Academy of Fine Arts\") is an institution of higher education in Turin, Italy. Its precursor dated to the first half of the 17th century. In 1678 the academy was formally founded as the Academy of Painters, Sculptors and Architects (Accademia dei Pittori, Scultori e Architetti) by Marie Jeanne of Savoy. It was re-established under the name Albertina in 1883 by Charles Albert of Sardinia. The academy witnessed the transition of artistic movements during the late 19th to early 20th century, from realism to eclecticism and the Liberty style, in the works of painters Antonio Fontanesi and Giacomo Grosso, and sculptors Vincenzo Vela and Odoardo Tabacchi. Turin became a leading centre of visual arts during the mid-20th century. The academy is home to an art gallery (the Pinacoteca), which was founded to serve in the training of the academy's students. Its collection includes that donated by Mossi di Morano, the Archbishop of Casale Monferrato, in 1828, and 16th-century cartoons by Gaudenzio Ferrari and his school, which were donated by Charles Albert in 1832.\r\nThe Mossi di Morano collection includes 16thâ€“17th-century Flemish and Dutch works, 17thâ€“18th-century Venetian paintings, and important 16thâ€“17th-century Piedmontese works including those of Defendente Ferrari and Giovanni Martino Spanzotti, among others. Notable works include Saint Ambrose and Saint Gregory, Doctors of the Church by Filippo Lippi, Ferrari's The Lamentation of Christ, Deposition in the Sepulchre by Maarten van Heemskerck, After the Battle by Cornelis de Wael, Portrait of a Gentleman, Three-Quarters View by Nicolas Lagneau, Hercules and the Nemean Lion by Ignazio Collino, and Giuseppe Pietro Bagetti's Mountainous Landscape with Coastal Inlets.

The event which led to the construction of the church occurred on 6 June 1453 during the war between Louis of Savoy and France. A group of French soldier had plundered the main church in Exilles, a town in the Val di Susa. On 6 June, the day of the Feast of Corpus Christi, they went to Turin to sell the booty. The donkey which transported the sacramental bread from the Exilles' church fell on the ground and the Holy Spirit rose and illuminated the square from the air. To celebrate the event, the painting of the Holy Name of Jesus was painted on the four gates of the city but this was deemed insufficient, and in 1509 a small chapel was soon commissioned on the present church's site. However, nothing was built until 1521, when Innocenzo Cybo, archbishop of Turin, ordered the construction of a small oratory of Matteo Sanmicheli. This was demolished in 1607 to make room to the modern basilica.\r\nThe design of the new church was commissioned to Ascanio Vitozzi. Amedeo di Castellamonte collaborated in the designing of the faÃ§ade. Works began in 1607. In 1753 king Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy commissioned Benedetto Alfieri to restore the interior decoration and to ornament it with stuccoes.\r\n","tips":"","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Corpus_Domini","visit_time":20,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Corpus Domini","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.07262","7.68271"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"+39 0114366025","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.30","time_to":"11.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"15.00","time_to":"18.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56baf95d32733015650006ba/basilica_corpus_domini.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5698dc0a3273301565000684","distance":44,"time_walk":53,"time_bike":27},{"id":"565ed65632733015650001f3","distance":60,"time_walk":72,"time_bike":36},{"id":"56952f9732733015650005d6","distance":101,"time_walk":122,"time_bike":61},{"id":"5698d566327330156500066e","distance":118,"time_walk":142,"time_bike":71},{"id":"5673f696327330156500035e","distance":139,"time_walk":167,"time_bike":84},{"id":"56977b663273301565000617","distance":180,"time_walk":217,"time_bike":108},{"id":"5695206232733015650005be","distance":193,"time_walk":233,"time_bike":116},{"id":"565ed4d632733015650001f0","distance":193,"time_walk":233,"time_bike":116},{"id":"569911493273301565000696","distance":204,"time_walk":246,"time_bike":123},{"id":"5696258c32733015650005f0","distance":209,"time_walk":252,"time_bike":126}]},{"id":"5677ec973273301565000376","type":"Palaces and Castles","name":"Chiablese Palace","description":"Chiablese Palace is a wing of the Royal Palace of Turin, it was the residence of the Duke of Chablais first and then of Carlo Felice, King of Sardinia, and Ferdinando, Duke of Genoa.

The first major reconstruction leading to the church we see today was commissioned in 1678 from the architect Guarino Guarini and the engineer Antonio Bertola. He created the elliptical shape of the church nave. The architect Filippo Juvarra in 1729-1740 added the North presbytery, thus creating a church with two apparent axis: a main altar on the east, while retaining the famed icon as a chapel to the North. The neoclassical facade, portico, and burial crypt on the south-north axis date from 1845-1860 with contributions by Pietro Anselmetti; further additions were made in 1899-1904 under the guidance of Carlo Ceppi. The interior has a jubilantly polychrome rococo decoration with colored marbles and solomonic columns. The Juvarra altar has two marble angels in adoration by Carlo Antonio Tantardini. The interior has a sculpture of two praying queens by Vincenzo Vela. Outside the church is a statue of a virgin and child on a column. The church serves as a burial place for a number of saints affiliated with Turin: Giuseppe Cafasso, Giovanni Bosco, and Leonardo Murialdo, as well as the Blessed Giuseppe Allamano, rector (1880-1926) and founder of the Mission Institute of the Consolata. Every June 20, a procession of the icon of the Virgin takes place in the streets of the city. The church is an eclectic collection of architecture, and includes portions of an ancient Roman wall, a Romanesque bell-tower, a baroque set of domes, almost Byzantine, sheltering a gothic icon, with two porticos, one of which has Neoclassic severity.","tips":"It is held that in the fifth century, Bishop Maximus erected a church dedicated to St Andrew Apostle with a small chapel to the Virgin with an icon.

The battle took place on the day of St Lawrence (San Lorenzo), and helped to shape the outcome of the Treaty of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis; in which, the Savoy, including Turin, was returned to the rule of the mercenary Duke. Emmanuel Philibert on his return to Turin in 1562, renovated the old ducal chapel of Santa Maria ad Presepae (still present near the entrance), and created this church dedicated to St. Lawrence. The construction of the church we see today began in 1634. The architect Guarino Guarini was a great innovator in Baroque principles first developed by the great Roman Baroque architect Francesco Borromini, in particular the play with optical effects and organic \"deconstruction\" of the classical orders and principles of column and entablature. However, in San Lorenzo, Guarini took these further. The ground plan is a kind of square which becomes an octagon at the level of the entablatures above the columns only to change again to become a Greek cross at the level of the pendentives of the vaults.

The miracle was attributed to the intervention of an image of the Virgin of the Annunciation, which was placed on a votive pillar. The painting became such an item of devotion, that this church was built at the site, enlarged in 1779, and furnished with a baptistery in 1807. Repeated reconstructions have altered the interior, and the church retains only some of the original decoration consisting of stuccoes attributed to Giovanni Andrea Casella and the cupola frescoes by Bartolomeo Guidobono. The main altar houses the miraculous icon dating from 1587, now thoroughly restored.","tips":"The miracle for which the church was built recalls that the riverbank nearby once housed a number of mills. A flour miller's daughter fell into the river at dusk. Her Mother, hearing her cries, but unable to see where she was to rescue her, knelt before a nearby shrine built next to the mill, depicting the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin. Legend holds a miraculous shaft of light illuminated the spot where her daughter was, and allowed her to be rescued by neighbors. News of the miracle led to the erection of a church by 1645, which became a Parish church March 2, 1807. The picture of the Madonna behind the main altar recalls the event.","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_del_Pilone,_Turin","visit_time":20,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"corso Casale ","street_number":"195","coordinates":["45.07005","7.72445"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"website","value":"http://www.madonnadelpilone.it/","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"12.15"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"16.00","time_to":"18.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb0f713273301565000712/chiesa_della_madonna_del_pilone.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"569921cc32733015650006a2","distance":545,"time_walk":657,"time_bike":328},{"id":"5693c1ee3273301565000506","distance":1762,"time_walk":2123,"time_bike":1061},{"id":"565db4f53273301565000151","distance":1858,"time_walk":2239,"time_bike":1119},{"id":"567985a232733015650003f6","distance":1951,"time_walk":2351,"time_bike":1175},{"id":"565d90453273301565000101","distance":2028,"time_walk":2443,"time_bike":1222},{"id":"565edd4d32733015650001fc","distance":2168,"time_walk":2612,"time_bike":1306},{"id":"565f0ee7327330156500021f","distance":2194,"time_walk":2643,"time_bike":1322},{"id":"5694d3583273301565000586","distance":2206,"time_walk":2658,"time_bike":1329},{"id":"56961c0932733015650005ec","distance":2241,"time_walk":2700,"time_bike":1350},{"id":"5678325632733015650003a7","distance":2350,"time_walk":2831,"time_bike":1416}]},{"id":"56978229327330156500062a","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"St Teresa Church","description":"Construction for this church originally belonging to the Carmelite Order, was begun in 1642 and was completed in 1672 under the patronage of the Ducal Regent, Christine Marie of France.

Today's garden dates back to 1713, when Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia established the Royal Garden. With the establishment in 1729 of the university's chair in botany, held by G.B. Caccia, it legally became part of the university.\r\nBetween 1730 and 1731 the garden was laid out in a geometric plan of flowerbeds within the Castello del Valentino's existing garden area (approximate 6800 m2), within which Caccia planted about 800 species. By 1762, 1200 species were in cultivation. By 1810 the garden contained about 6000 cultivated plants, with an arboretum organized on its northern section (the boschetto), and the constructions of greenhouses, orangery, and herbarium. Between 1831 and 1839 further construction added more greenhouses, and in 1848 a substantial orangery. The garden was extensively damaged, with loss of collections, during World War I and World War II by neglect and bombings. However, the garden is now recovering. Prof. Bruno Peyronel introduced an alpine garden in 1962â€“1963, in 1969 a new greenhouse was built for tropical and subtropical species, in 1986 another greenhouse added for succulent plants, and in 2006 another for South African plants.\r\nToday the garden proper cultivates around 2000 species, with additional 300 species in the alpine garden, about 500 species in the arboretum, and a further 1000 species in greenhouses.","tips":"","wikipedia":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orto_Botanico_dell%27UniversitÃ _di_Torino","visit_time":45,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Viale Mattioli","street_number":"25","coordinates":["45.05507","7.68568"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Full","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Reduced","description":"","price":"3.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Free","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Cumulative full","description":"","price":"50.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Cumulative reduced","description":"","price":"40.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"website","value":"http://www.ortobotanico.unito.it/","description":""},{"type":"phone","value":"+39011 6705970","description":""}],"openings":[{"date_from":"9/4","date_to":"9/10","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"12.00"},{"date_from":"9/4","date_to":"9/10","days":["sa"],"time_from":"15.00","time_to":"19.00"},{"date_from":"9/4","date_to":"9/10","days":["su"],"time_from":"10.00","time_to":"13.00"},{"date_from":"9/4","date_to":"9/10","days":["su"],"time_from":"15.00","time_to":"19.00"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb0fdf3273301565000715/orto_botanico.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"565dbe1b3273301565000166","distance":80,"time_walk":96,"time_bike":48},{"id":"569630683273301565000602","distance":542,"time_walk":653,"time_bike":327},{"id":"5694c98e3273301565000573","distance":562,"time_walk":677,"time_bike":339},{"id":"5694d89d327330156500058a","distance":586,"time_walk":706,"time_bike":353},{"id":"565f151a3273301565000230","distance":607,"time_walk":731,"time_bike":366},{"id":"5694c506327330156500056c","distance":634,"time_walk":764,"time_bike":382},{"id":"568fd86e327330156500047e","distance":647,"time_walk":780,"time_bike":390},{"id":"565f11203273301565000224","distance":666,"time_walk":802,"time_bike":401},{"id":"568f9198327330156500042a","distance":741,"time_walk":893,"time_bike":446},{"id":"568f7d1332733015650003fb","distance":751,"time_walk":905,"time_bike":452}]},{"id":"569637f83273301565000608","type":"Other monuments and Places of interest","name":"Torino Porta Susa railway station","description":"The station was built in 1868 during the expansion of the city towards the west.

The design was based on formal simplification and careful attention to functional and technical needs. Pagano and Gino Levi-Montalcini built Palazzo Gualino in 1928â€“29, with a flat roof rather than the sloped tile roof typical of other buildings in the city. The design covered all aspects of the building's intended use, including the layout, decoration, furniture and fixtures. Magazines and newspapers hailed the building as the symbol of a new direction in architecture, an expression of progress and an example of new ways of organizing offices and management activities. The Palazzo Gualino is considered to be a major statement of the emerging rationalist culture in Italy. The Turin Society of Engineers and Architects recognized the building in 1984 as important both historically and for its artistic value as one of the first buildings of Italian Rationalism.","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":10,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Corso Vittorio Emanuele II","street_number":"8","coordinates":["45.05928","7.68918"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5694d89d327330156500058a","distance":242,"time_walk":292,"time_bike":146},{"id":"5694c98e3273301565000573","distance":322,"time_walk":388,"time_bike":194},{"id":"565ec60732733015650001c0","distance":338,"time_walk":407,"time_bike":204},{"id":"5694c506327330156500056c","distance":433,"time_walk":522,"time_bike":261},{"id":"5693bbdc32733015650004ed","distance":542,"time_walk":653,"time_bike":327},{"id":"568fd86e327330156500047e","distance":553,"time_walk":666,"time_bike":333},{"id":"5679748a32733015650003b5","distance":600,"time_walk":723,"time_bike":361},{"id":"565dbe1b3273301565000166","distance":622,"time_walk":749,"time_bike":375},{"id":"56796b0232733015650003ab","distance":629,"time_walk":758,"time_bike":379},{"id":"5693c3fb327330156500050a","distance":641,"time_walk":772,"time_bike":386}]},{"id":"565da6d33273301565000123","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Giovanni and Marella Agnelli's Art Gallery","description":"The art gallery opened in 2002, after the restoration of the abandoned FIAT manufacturing site by Renzo Piano.

Viene chiamato Parco della Pellerina da un'antica cascina, ubicata all'esterno del parco, per la precisione all'intersezione di c.so Regina Margherita e via Pietro Cossa, che reca il nome di cascina della Pellerina. Il parco Ã¨ ufficialmente dedicato a Mario Carrara (1866-1937), antropologo dell'universitÃ  di Torino, uno dei soli 15 docenti universitari su oltre 1.200 che rifiutarono il Giuramento di fedeltÃ  al Fascismo, ma Ã¨ noto ai torinesi come Parco della Pellerina. La prima idea del parco venne agli inizi del '900, ma soltanto negli anni 1930 incominciarono i lavori. La costruzione del parco continuÃ² dopo il conflitto mondiale e ottenne la sistemazione attuale negli anni 1980.\r\nIl corso del fiume Dora Riparia all'interno del parco fu ampiamente modificato, rendendolo molto piÃ¹ lineare. Al suo interno vi sono alcune strutture sportive, tra le quali una piscina, campi da calcio (sia di proprietÃ  di societÃ  sportive e non), una pista di pattinaggio liberamente fruibile, una pista da BMX in terra battuta, campi da bocce e da tennis. Due laghi artificiali, di differenti dimensioni, ospitano una fauna acquatica rappresentata da numerose famiglie di germani reali, folaghe, gallinelle d'acqua e cigni. In una depressione in prossimitÃ  dei due laghi si Ã¨ recentemente, a seguito dell'alluvione dell'ottobre 2000, formato uno stagno completamente naturale, l'unico del genere nella cittÃ  di Torino. Si tratta di una zona umida di modesta profonditÃ  (max 80 cm), circondata da una corona di canne di palude e di tife a foglie strette .","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":60,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"corso appio claudio 110","street_number":"","coordinates":["45.08471","7.64173"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56bb16953273301565000737/parco_pellerina.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"56938dee32733015650004b6","distance":1062,"time_walk":1280,"time_bike":640},{"id":"565efcc73273301565000202","distance":1073,"time_walk":1293,"time_bike":646},{"id":"5673ec20327330156500033e","distance":1788,"time_walk":2154,"time_bike":1077},{"id":"56991e4e327330156500069e","distance":1812,"time_walk":2183,"time_bike":1092},{"id":"566832aa3273301565000295","distance":1837,"time_walk":2213,"time_bike":1107},{"id":"5667fdbb3273301565000268","distance":1881,"time_walk":2266,"time_bike":1133},{"id":"565edb2932733015650001f9","distance":1999,"time_walk":2408,"time_bike":1204},{"id":"56991b26327330156500069a","distance":2146,"time_walk":2586,"time_bike":1293},{"id":"5693959c32733015650004d3","distance":2219,"time_walk":2673,"time_bike":1337},{"id":"5668006a3273301565000270","distance":2385,"time_walk":2873,"time_bike":1437}]},{"id":"567980f032733015650003f0","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Santissima Annunziata Church","description":"Santissima Annunziata church is a neo-baroque building which was originally designed by Carlo Morello at the half of the XVII century.
