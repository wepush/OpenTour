Following several earthquakes, the church was seriously damaged, and, in 1678, it was renovated by the architect Paolo Amato. The style is typical of the period of the renovation: a lush Baroque, with the church walls richly decorated by 1700s stuccos, magnificent frescos on the dome and vault painted by Antonio Grano and Guglielmo Borremans, and a precious marble altar, designed by the painter Gaspare Serenario, with polychromic intaglios and semi-precious stones. A now walled 1500s portal, used to enable access to the adjacent convent. ","tips":"In 1919, what was once the monastery of Santa Chiara became a Salesian oratory, which is nowadays engaged in mediating among the different cultures that live side by side in Palermo. In the oratory, and specifically in what used to be the theatre room, during renovation works were found the remains of ancient Punic walls.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":25,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Santa Chiara","street_number":"11","coordinates":["38.11306","13.35974"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"091331141","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"7.00","time_to":"18.00"}],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b318c0000","distance":91,"time_walk":110,"time_bike":55},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31410200","distance":145,"time_walk":175,"time_bike":87},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31cb0100","distance":164,"time_walk":198,"time_bike":99},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31830300","distance":209,"time_walk":252,"time_bike":126},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b310e0100","distance":241,"time_walk":290,"time_bike":145},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31a50300","distance":248,"time_walk":299,"time_bike":149},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31250200","distance":250,"time_walk":301,"time_bike":151},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31d30100","distance":256,"time_walk":308,"time_bike":154},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31330100","distance":272,"time_walk":328,"time_bike":164},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31380200","distance":279,"time_walk":336,"time_bike":168}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b313e0300","type":"Other monuments and Places of interest","name":"Borsellino Tree","description":"After the massacre of July 19th 1992, in which the anti-Mafia prosecuting judge Paolo Borsellino and five of his police bodyguards were killed by the explosion of a car-bomb, in Via Mariano D’Amelio was planted a tree in memory of the victims of the massacre and commemorate them in the site of the massacre itself.

Following the allied occupation of Palermo (1943), during the Second World War, and with the purpose of clearing the streets of downtown from the rubble of the buildings that had collapsed due to the violent bombardments during the spring that year, the AMGOT provisional administration of the city decided to dump the mentioned rubble at sea, filling in the seawater immediately off the promenade that during the Fascist period had been named Foro Italico (Italian forum). During the early 1950s, the area remained bare and abandoned; it was utilised as a Rom camp and as an area to set up circuses; for years here was also a funfair. On the occasion of the UN conference on the fight against organised crime, which was held in Palermo in December 2000, the city administration initiated the reclamation and the environmental recuperation of the site. These works were completed in December 2000, when a grand event was organised on the lawn of the ‘new’ Foro; at this event participated also the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. The garden, fully closed to traffic, occupies about 40,000 square metres covered by a lawn, and it includes Mediterranean plants, tree-lined avenues, benches, ceramic sculptures, a bicycle track, nighttime lighting, and an ample panoramic seafront alongside the seashore.","tips":"The sculptures in the Foro are the work of the architect Italo Rota, and they are inspired by the profile of the marble bust of Eleanor of Aragon, which is preserved in the Sicilian regional gallery in Palazzo Abatellis.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":30,"accessibility":"","always_open":true,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Corso Foro Italico","street_number":"","coordinates":["38.11661","13.37568"]},"tickets":[],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0917401111","description":null}],"openings":[],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56129baf3273306d31000024/foro_italico.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae77694d610b318c0300","distance":143,"time_walk":172,"time_bike":86},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31c10100","distance":245,"time_walk":295,"time_bike":148},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31350200","distance":263,"time_walk":317,"time_bike":158},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b312e0200","distance":299,"time_walk":360,"time_bike":180},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b311e0300","distance":328,"time_walk":395,"time_bike":198},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31f50000","distance":354,"time_walk":427,"time_bike":213},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31960000","distance":374,"time_walk":451,"time_bike":225},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31540200","distance":375,"time_walk":452,"time_bike":226},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31860200","distance":414,"time_walk":499,"time_bike":249},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b318e0300","distance":416,"time_walk":501,"time_bike":251}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b311c0000","type":"Villas, Gardens and Parks","name":"Garden of the Zisa","description":"Palermo’s garden of the Zisa (inaugurated in 2005) is located in what used to be the ancient Genoardo, in front of the Palazzo della Zisa, and it has a total surface of 30,000 square metres.","tips":"","wikipedia":"","visit_time":20,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Guglielmo Il Buono","street_number":"90138","coordinates":["38.11684","13.34452"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0916520269","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"18.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":[],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"13.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56129bb53273306d31000026/giardino_della_zisa.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31140000","distance":303,"time_walk":365,"time_bike":183},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31510300","distance":310,"time_walk":373,"time_bike":187},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31120300","distance":371,"time_walk":447,"time_bike":223},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31360300","distance":532,"time_walk":641,"time_bike":320},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31060100","distance":604,"time_walk":728,"time_bike":364},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b315e0200","distance":658,"time_walk":793,"time_bike":396},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31360000","distance":716,"time_walk":863,"time_bike":431},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b314d0200","distance":752,"time_walk":906,"time_bike":453},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31ee0100","distance":840,"time_walk":1012,"time_bike":506},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31290100","distance":844,"time_walk":1017,"time_bike":508}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31210200","type":"Churches, Oratories and Places of worship","name":"Oratory of Santa Caterina d’Alessandria","description":"It was erected around 1638 by the Compagnia di Santa Caterina d'Alessandria (company of Saint Catherine of Alexandria), which had been founded in 1593.

During the Easter Night celebrations, a Tila falls during the Gloria, unveiling the main altar, and visually announcing the Christ Resurrected.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":25,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza San Domenico","street_number":"90133","coordinates":["38.11895","13.36329"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"091589172","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.domenicani-palermo.it/","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"01/10","date_to":"31/05","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"12.00"},{"date_from":"01/07","date_to":"30/09","days":["mo","tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"8.30","time_to":"11.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56129b653273306d3100000b/chiesa_di_san_domenico.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31c90200","distance":9,"time_walk":11,"time_bike":5},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b319a0100","distance":94,"time_walk":113,"time_bike":57},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b315d0300","distance":167,"time_walk":201,"time_bike":101},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b310a0200","distance":168,"time_walk":202,"time_bike":101},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31aa0100","distance":171,"time_walk":206,"time_bike":103},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b314c0100","distance":198,"time_walk":239,"time_bike":119},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31b20100","distance":206,"time_walk":248,"time_bike":124},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31dc0000","distance":213,"time_walk":257,"time_bike":128},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31920100","distance":223,"time_walk":269,"time_bike":134},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b317e0300","distance":224,"time_walk":270,"time_bike":135}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31d10200","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Palazzo Ziino","description":"It includes a multi-media library, a gypsotheque, and an exhibition space, where numerous important art exhibits take place.

The observatory was founded in 1790 at the behest of the King of Naples and of Sicily Ferdinand I of Bourbon, who had been encouraged by some intellectuals of the time to endow the Sicilian city of an element of prestige, like an observatory. The three domes that originally stood on the roof of the building were replaced in the 1950s by others made of iron, which were eventually removed due to their excessive weight and to the danger they posed to the structure; subsequently, new copper domes were installed, which were lighter than the previous ones.

Since 1673, the Princes Bonanno, to whom had been entrusted surveillance of the Vega bastion (built in 1540 and dismantled for the most part in 1783), had a ‘little house’ built on top of it, in which, traditionally, lived the first-born son of the Prince. This residence was renovated in 1793 through the work of the architect Domenico Fugazza Furetto. On September 20th, 1820, the little house was destroyed during a cannonade, and never rebuilt. In 1833, the estate was sold to the Marquis Enrico Carlo Forcella and subsequently inherited by his nephew. In 1875, it was sold to Biagio Licata, Prince of Baucina by way of marriage, and upon his death in 1893, it was passed on to his son; the Princes of Licata of Baucina extended the palazzo toward the garden, creating in it the ‘castelletto’ (little castle) on a design by the Sicilian architect and restorer Giuseppe Patricolo. In the early 1900s, it was purchased by the Marquis Francesco de Seta, who had the palazzo’s Neoclassical room frescoed by the painter Onofrio Tomaselli. Between 1937 and 1940, the edifice housed the Galleria Mediterranea (Mediterranean gallery), the only modern art gallery in Palermo at the time, which was directed by the painter Lia Pasqualino.","tips":"In the 1950s, the palazzo was turned into a social club and gambling house, and subsequently into the seat of the council of administrative justice.

Also as fascinating is the building façade facing toward the city, which opens on the Via Butera, in which is found the palazzo’s main entrance, with a marvellous series of rooms that is about ten-metres-long. During the last century, additional modifications have involved the building’s interior, including the replacement of he majolica floors, and the partial alienation of the 1700s furniture, which caused the building to lose part of its original charm.

The two 1700s renovation campaigns are worth remembering, which are due to the genius of the architect from Trapani Andrea Gigante: the monumental grand staircase adorned by the marble statues by Palermo’s sculptor Ignazio Francesco Marabitti and the fretworked Galleria, whose style is influenced by that typical of the work of the Bibiena family of architects, places the renovation effort well within a far-reaching international cultural framework, although it remains entirely original and typically Sicilian. This result is not due exclusively to the undisputed quality of the artistic and architectural interventions, which involved the protagonists of Sicilian culture of the time, but also to the unusual family events that accompanied the history of the palazzo, which remains the property of the direct descendents of Pietro and Marianna Valguarnera, those who built it three centuries ago.

Following Basile’s death, the architect was replaced by his son, the eventually more famous and iconic architect for the city, Ernesto, who, upon request by the City of Palermo, agreed to complete the building, whose construction had been started under the direction of his father.

The basin was protected to the east by the Castello a Mare (castle by the sea); the dock was built between 1300 and 1445, and it remained the city’s main until the 16th century, during which began the development of the port areas of the Santa Lucia (today’s Borgo Vecchio) and Sant’Erasmo neighbourhoods. Although over the centuries most ship traffic shifted from the Cala to the harbour proper, this inlet still attracted the interest of Palermo’s urban planners in the different historical periods. Currently the Cala presents itself like a U-shaped marina in Palermo’s historical centre.","tips":"Some of the projects that won the competition for the city’s urban development plan of 1939 called for it to be filled in or squared up, or even for a bridge to be built, which, across the Cala, would have linked the Lungomare Crispi with the Foro Italico.

On the building’s first floor is the Cappella Palatina (palace chapel). The first edifice of the complex, the Qasr, that is palace or castle, is thought to date back to the period of the Islamic domination of Sicily (9th century). The Norman rulers transformed the Arab edifice into a multipurpose complex, which was meant to convey the full might of their monarchy. A structure with tower-like buildings was, therefore, realised, which were connected to each other though a system of porticos alternated to gardens, which also hosted goldsmith and fabric production workshops (the Kiraz). The complex, furthermore, was directly connected to the Cathedral through a covered street. The Palazzo is also the seat of Palermo’s “Giuseppe S. Vaiana” observatory. ","tips":"Inside the Palazzo is located the Cappella Palatina, a basilica with a nave and two aisles dedicated to the Saints Peter and Paul. It was built at the behest of King Roger II, and it was consecrated on April 28th, 1140, as church of the royal family.

Restored during the 1950s under the direction of the architect Carlo Scarpa and other architects from Palermo, it is today the seat of the Rectorate of the University of Palermo. In the prisons of the Palazzo are still visible precious graffiti left by the inmates, a unique testimony of the sufferings under that institution of the Ancien Régime. In three cells of the ground floor, which housed female prisoners, were found graffiti that were previously completely unknown: drawings of human figures and invocations of the prisoners accused of witchcraft.

Once completed, the palazzo was one of Palermo’s most sumptuous. However, the Santa Croce family soon died out, and after barely a century, the palazzo passed on to Romualdo Trigona e Gravina, Prince of Sant'Elia, and cousin of the last female descendant of the Santa Croces. Also this family maintained property of the palazzo for a little over a century. After having been used for widely different purposes, in 1984 it was acquired by Palermo’s province administration. Restoration works starting in 2000 finally put an end to the state of neglect of the historic aristocratic residence, salvaging facades, courtyards, stables, and the frescos present in every room.","tips":"Contrary to what has been assumed until today, the designer of the palazzo may be a yet unknown architect. According to very recent studies, in fact, the architect Nicolò Anito, previously credited with creating the palazzo, may not have been its actual author, but only one of the architects who carried on the work starting in 1756. Only starting in 1759, Anito was replaced once and for all by Giovanbattista Cascione, who assumed the direction of the construction.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":75,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Maqueda","street_number":"81","coordinates":["38.11229","13.36376"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Variabile","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0916628289","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"fondazionesantelia@gmail.com","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.fondazionesantelia.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"13.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"16.00","time_to":"19.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/560bb181327330384b000014/palazzo_sant_elia.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31990300","distance":74,"time_walk":89,"time_bike":45},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31380200","distance":177,"time_walk":213,"time_bike":107},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31250200","distance":221,"time_walk":266,"time_bike":133},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31d30100","distance":259,"time_walk":312,"time_bike":156},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b318c0000","distance":280,"time_walk":337,"time_bike":169},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31ed0000","distance":293,"time_walk":353,"time_bike":177},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31540100","distance":294,"time_walk":354,"time_bike":177},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31330100","distance":303,"time_walk":365,"time_bike":183},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31ff0000","distance":317,"time_walk":382,"time_bike":191},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31830200","distance":321,"time_walk":387,"time_bike":193}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31d60200","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Palermo’s Arsenal — Museum of the Sea","description":"Opened in 1997, it is located within the old Bourbon arsenal of the city. Inside the museum are on display two cannons from the Bourbon period that had been cast between 1781 and 1785. On display are also some original pilot’s books, which included technical directions for a safe landing in various harbours. Here can be admired scale reproductions of xebecs, galleys, and gunboats, fruit of the passion of the founding members of the museum. The rectangle-shaped arsenal was built between January 24th, 1621, day in which the foundation stone was laid, and 1630, on a design by Palermo’s architect Mariano Smiriglio. The building maintained its shipbuilding function until 1797, year in which the last row ship was built and launched. In 1943, it was seriously damaged by airstrikes, losing its rear section, utilised to build boats of the Italian Royal Navy, together with the little church of Santa Maria.","tips":"During the years in which the arsenal started ‘churning out’ boats, the presence of pirates was dominant on Palermo’s coast. These pirates came mostly from Tunis and caused panic among the inhabitants of the coast of Palermo’s province. Between 1641 and 1644, there are confirmed instances of raids in which the homes of many locals were plundered and their inhabitants abducted. During that time, in Palermo operated the Opera per la Redenzione dei Cattivi (society for the redemption of captives), which worked toward the redemption of slaves, in other words, to pay their ransom. It functioned through the collection of charity, and by means of special envoys to Tunis, managed sometimes to retrieve Sicilians who had been made slaves in Barbary.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":30,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":0,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via dell'Arsenale","street_number":"142","coordinates":["38.13559","13.36625"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"091361309","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.arsenaledipalermo.it","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["sa","su"],"time_from":"9.30","time_to":"12.30"}],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31070300","distance":1039,"time_walk":1252,"time_bike":626},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31180100","distance":1056,"time_walk":1272,"time_bike":636},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31510000","distance":1289,"time_walk":1553,"time_bike":777},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b313e0300","distance":1304,"time_walk":1571,"time_bike":786},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31890200","distance":1429,"time_walk":1722,"time_bike":861},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31780300","distance":1436,"time_walk":1730,"time_bike":865},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b310b0000","distance":1440,"time_walk":1735,"time_bike":867},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31d30000","distance":1456,"time_walk":1754,"time_bike":877},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31980200","distance":1495,"time_walk":1801,"time_bike":901},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31670200","distance":1507,"time_walk":1816,"time_bike":908}]},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31e40200","type":"Museums and Art galleries","name":"Mineralogy Museum","description":"Reborn thanks to an agreement between the association Geoide and the University of Palermo, the university museum preserves thousands of specimens of minerals, often rare, coming from the whole world, as well as a meteorite collection.

Still on the ground floor is found the Gambero Rosso culinary school and the Branciforte Restaurant, which specialises in dishes of the Mediterranean tradition, and which exhibits a rich collection of majolica objects. The building also includes a state-of-the-art auditorium (Sala dei 99) designed by the renowned architect Gae Aulenti. On the first floor of the building is the large library of the Fondazione Sicilia, which includes about 50,000 volumes, and the rooms that house the numismatic and philatelic collections, and sculptures by important artists of the 1800s and 1900s, like, for instance, Giacomo Manzù, Lucio Fontana, Emilio Greco, and Igor Mitoraj. Above the room is a grand fresco by Ignazio Moncada di Paternò.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":75,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Bara all'Olivella","street_number":"2","coordinates":["38.12027","13.36234"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"7.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[null,null]},{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[null,null]},{"type":"Gruppi","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0918887767","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"info@palazzobranciforte.it","description":null},{"type":"website","value":"www.palazzobranciforte.it/home.php","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"01/03","date_to":"31/10","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"19.30"},{"date_from":"01/11","date_to":"28/02","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"14.30"}],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31dc0000","distance":124,"time_walk":149,"time_bike":75},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31aa0100","distance":151,"time_walk":182,"time_bike":91},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31920100","distance":152,"time_walk":183,"time_bike":92},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31210200","distance":156,"time_walk":188,"time_bike":94},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31c90200","distance":160,"time_walk":193,"time_bike":96},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b319a0100","distance":167,"time_walk":201,"time_bike":101},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31cc0000","distance":167,"time_walk":201,"time_bike":101},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31e40100","distance":180,"time_walk":217,"time_bike":108},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b318f0200","distance":181,"time_walk":218,"time_bike":109},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31680100","distance":234,"time_walk":282,"time_bike":141}]},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31670300","type":"Palaces and Castles","name":"Palazzina Cinese","description":"Also known as Casina Cinese (little Chinese house), is an ancient royal residence of the Bourbons of Naples, located at the fringes of the Parco della Favorita, Palermo’s largest park, at the border of the natural reserve of Monte Pellegrino. It was realised by the architect Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia in 1799 on a commission by King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon, who had purchased from the lawyer Lombardo a wooden house in Chinese style alongside some estates that bordered it. Marvuglia carried out the work maintaining the building’s Oriental style: the main body of the edifice is capped by a pagoda-style roof supported by an octagonal drum. The building is comprised of curious elements: the bells of the entry grate, the beams in carved wood of the terraces, and the scallops. Between 1800 and 1806, the two pavilions of the royal hunters were realised. After the unification of Italy (during the period 1861–1946), ownership of the Palazzina and park passed on to the Italian Royal Family of the house of Savoy, and subsequently to the State; once park and Palazzina became a property of the City of Palermo, they were destined to tourist visits, whereas in the building’s annexes was housed the Pitrè Sicilian ethnographic museum.","tips":"In the drawing room of the Palazzina is located the famous tavola matematica (mathematical table) designed by Marvuglia, which includes a device that enables plates and dishes to go directly to and from the downstairs kitchens, avoiding the need for the help of the household staff. The relevant mechanism was restored by Palermo’s delegation of the FAI (Italian environmental fund) on the occasion of the Spring Day event of 1999.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":60,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Via Duca degli Abruzzi","street_number":"1","coordinates":["38.16678","13.33024"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"6.0","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[null,null]},{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[null]},{"type":"Gruppi","description":"","price":"5.0","recipients":[]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"0917071317","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"17.30"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["su"],"time_from":"9.00","time_to":"13.30"}],"pictures":[{"picture":"https://open-tour.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/file/56129bd33273306d31000031/palazzina_cinese.jpg"}],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b319d0200","distance":64,"time_walk":77,"time_bike":39},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31490300","distance":122,"time_walk":147,"time_bike":73},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b312e0300","distance":1897,"time_walk":2286,"time_bike":1143},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31720200","distance":2759,"time_walk":3324,"time_bike":1662},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31550300","distance":3327,"time_walk":4008,"time_bike":2004},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b313e0300","distance":3398,"time_walk":4094,"time_bike":2047},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31070300","distance":3683,"time_walk":4437,"time_bike":2219},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31980200","distance":3963,"time_walk":4775,"time_bike":2387},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31890200","distance":3996,"time_walk":4814,"time_bike":2407},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b313a0300","distance":4010,"time_walk":4831,"time_bike":2416}]},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b316f0300","type":"Palaces and Castles","name":"Palazzo Asmundo","description":"Although construction of the edifice began in 1615, the palazzo was only completed in 1767. Before the President of Justice Giuseppe Asmundo Paternò, Marquis of Sessa, came to own it, it had belonged to the Joppolo family of the Princes of Sant’Elia. The palazzo (as a tablet located there reminds) welcomed Maria Cristina, daughter of Ferdinand III King of Sicily, refugee from Naples, alongside her husband Carlo. Another tablet, placed on the main façade of the palazzo, evokes the birth in this building in 1821 and 1822, respectively, of Anna Turrisi Colonna, an art critic, and her sister Giuseppina, a poet. Frenchman Gastone Vuiller, who briefly stayed in the palazzo, mentions it in his book La Sicilia, impressioni del presente e del passato (Sicily, impressions of the present and of the past), published in Milan by the Treves Brothers in 1897. Many are the artworks that make this palazzo one of the most beautiful of Baroque Palermo. Suffice to remember the frescos with allegories by Gioacchino Martorana, a 1700s Sicilian painter. From the building’s balconies, it is possible to admire Palermo’s Cathedral in its entirety.","tips":"Interesting and varied is the collection of piety and wealth tiles, which are full of history and iconographic messages, and are linked to Sicily’s most fervently worshipped Saints. Worth noting, furthermore, is the rich porcelain collection, most of it from the 1800s. Moreover, in Palazzo Asmundo are collected weapons of different type, among them, rod weapons, blow weapons, cannons, different types of rifles, pistols and revolvers, powder flasks, shields, and various tools.

The square in front of the palazzo, which used to be known as Piano d’Aragona, is today named after the family. During the first half of the 17th century, the Alliata di Villafranca family purchased the palazzo, and, for four centuries, it has been the Alliatas’ main Palermo residence. The two large stucco coat-of-arms, those of the Alliata, Princes of Villafranca, are the work of the iconic Sicilian Baroque sculptor Giacomo Serpotta. The palazzo once hosted one of the most important art collections of the city; art works still visible today are the famous crucifixion by Van Dyck, whose commissioning documents are preserved in the family archives.","tips":"After 1824, the Alliatas founded the first Sicilian winery, the Duca di Salaparuta (Duke of Salaparuta), known for the Corvo brand wines, which was destined to become a very prestigious firm.","wikipedia":"","visit_time":40,"accessibility":"","always_open":false,"priority":1,"featured":false,"ticket_notes":"","opening_notes":"","location":{"street_name":"Piazza Bologni","street_number":"18","coordinates":["38.11487","13.36037"]},"tickets":[{"type":"Intero","description":"","price":"4.5","recipients":[]},{"type":"Ridotto","description":"","price":"3.5","recipients":[null,null,null]},{"type":"Gratuito","description":"","price":"0.0","recipients":[null,null]}],"contacts":[{"type":"phone","value":"3348671386","description":null},{"type":"email","value":"palazzoalliatadivillafranca@gmail.com","description":null}],"openings":[{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"10.00","time_to":"14.00"},{"date_from":"","date_to":"","days":["tu","we","th","fr","sa","su"],"time_from":"16.00","time_to":"20.00"}],"pictures":[],"nearest_sites":[{"id":"5506ae76694d610b310e0100","distance":47,"time_walk":57,"time_bike":28},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31820000","distance":108,"time_walk":130,"time_bike":65},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31370100","distance":119,"time_walk":143,"time_bike":72},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31490000","distance":134,"time_walk":161,"time_bike":81},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31330100","distance":150,"time_walk":181,"time_bike":90},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31460000","distance":156,"time_walk":188,"time_bike":94},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31cb0100","distance":160,"time_walk":193,"time_bike":96},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31a00300","distance":163,"time_walk":196,"time_bike":98},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31540100","distance":182,"time_walk":219,"time_bike":110},{"id":"5506ae76694d610b31870100","distance":197,"time_walk":237,"time_bike":119}]},{"id":"5506ae77694d610b31ab0300","type":"Palaces and Castles","name":"Royal Hospice for Poor Women (Reale Albergo delle Povere)","description":"It was founded with the name Reale Albergo dei Poveri (Royal hospice for the poor) in 1733, during the short-lasting Austrian viceroyame of Sicily (1720–1734), with the purpose of sheltering poor invalids, cripples, and young vagabond and orphaned women.

During the 16th century, Paolo Ferreri, Baron of Pettineo, had the first nucleus of the palazzo built. Since 1748, the building is recorded as being owned by Vincenzo Termine, Count of Isnello and Prince of Baucina, who commissioned the extension of the palazzo to an unknown architect. Construction, which incorporated six pre-existing medieval buildings, whose traces are still visible, was completed in 1750. In 1760, the main floor was frescoed by Vito D’Anna and Francesco Sozzi. During the 19th century, Palazzo Isnello became the property of Vincenzo Ruffo Filangieri, Prince of Sant’Antimo. During the same century, in the palazzo lived the historian and Arabist Michele Amari, until when, in 1843, after having expressed his autonomist and revolutionary ideas in the essay La Guerra del Vespro Siciliano (the war of the Sicilian Vespers), which was unwelcome by the Bourbon government of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, he was exiled to France.","tips":"On March 28th, 2007, for the bicentennial of the birth of Michele Amari (2006), the city of Palermo placed a commemorative tablet on the Via Isnello façade of the palazzo.
